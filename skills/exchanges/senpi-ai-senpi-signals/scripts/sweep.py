"""senpi-signals sweep — the whole gather in ONE process, then score.py. No agent orchestration.

    python3 sweep.py --print-feed          # what an agent runs for a user: prints only the feed
    python3 sweep.py --brief 3             # the short version another skill closes with: top 3 reads, one line each

    (SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN / SENPI_MCP_URL from env, like senpi-smart-money)

2.0 is ONE READING with no compare: it reads the market now, ranks what that reading shows, and keeps
no history, so back-to-back runs give the same feed. Compare over periods is v2.

What one sweep reads (the read budget, printed as `reads=<n>` at the end):
    1   market_list_instruments        universe + OI + price + 24h move + funding + volume, both dexes
    1   discovery_get_top_traders      the proven cohort (>= $1M lifetime realized), one page of 1000
    3   discovery_get_trader_state     the cohort's books, 50 wallets per read (SAMPLE_CAP 150)
    1   leaderboard_get_markets        the 4h board: crowd side, hot_4h_share, 4h price move
    1   leaderboard_get_momentum_events  the platform's own tiered whale/momentum events
    1   market_get_cross_asset_flows   BTC-led laggards
  = 8 reads. Every read fails soft: a failed source is recorded in `coverage`, the rest of the sweep
  still lands.

The cohort engine (smartmoney.py) and the MCP transport (mcp_client.py) are verbatim copies of
senpi-smart-money's, kept next to this file: skills install standalone, so this one never reaches into
another skill's folder. tests/test_vendored_parity.py fails when the copies drift.

Outputs (in --out-dir; default $SENPI_STATE_DIR/signals or ~/.openclaw/senpi-state/signals), overwritten
each run: current.json and signals.md. Nothing else is written. Stdlib only; Python 3.9+.
