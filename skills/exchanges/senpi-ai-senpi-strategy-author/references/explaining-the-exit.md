# Explaining the exit — the preview you show before you build

`lock 10% at +100%` reads as *take 10% profit at +100%*. It means *once you are up 100%, put the
stop at 10% of your best*. A trade peaking at +93% never reaches that only rung, so nothing is ever
locked and the whole gain round-trips. The config is valid and reports healthy the entire way down.

## The sentence

Lives in SKILL.md decision 7 — one copy, said every time. Don't restate it here; two copies of a
sentence is the exact drift this file exists to stop.

The parenthetical ("up for long, down for short") is doing real work on a short book: the stop always
climbs in **ROE** terms, but in **price** terms a short's floor sits above entry and falls as the
trade wins (`roeToPriceFloor` branches on direction).

**It is a stop-loss that follows, not profit-taking.** Nothing is sold on the way up; no rung ever
closes a winner. If the user says "take profit at X", correct the framing before you set a number.

Field-by-field behaviour — close reasons, DSL events, how the exchange stop relates to the
floor — is in [`dsl-configuration.md`](dsl-configuration.md).

## The arithmetic (from the engine, not from memory)

`src/dsl/engine/floors.ts` in senpi-trading-runtime:

- `tierIndexFromPrice` — the active rung is the **highest** tier whose `trigger_pct` the ROE has
  reached. Below the first trigger there is no rung at all.
- `computeTierFloor` — `floorRoe = highWaterRoe × lock_hw_pct / 100`.

Two consequences worth saying out loud, because both surprise people:

1. The floor tracks the **high-water** ROE — the best the trade ever reached — not where it is now.
2. Below the first `trigger_pct` nothing is locked; the only floor is `phase1.max_loss_pct`
   (`phase1.enabled: false` fleet-wide, so the trailing floor does not apply).

## The template

Lead with where the trade is now — the downside floor — then climb. Rungs, then how it
behaves, then the preset's own time cuts.

> **Here's the DSL settings on this strategy**
> • Below +20% → nothing is locked in yet; your only floor is the **−8% max loss**.
> • Up 20% → your stop moves to **+5%**. From here the trade can't lose money.
> • Up 50% → your stop moves to **+30%**.
> • Up 100% → your stop moves to **+85%**.
>
> The stop follows the **best** price the trade ever hit, not where it is now — peak at +50%, drift
> back to +35%, and that +30% stop is still the one holding. It only moves up, never down, and
> nothing is sold while the trade is still climbing.

That worked example is `let_winners_run`, which carries **no time cuts**. Add a line for the ones the
chosen preset actually has — each row names the cut and its real duration, checked against `dsl-presets.yaml` by the test:

| preset | time cuts to mention |
|---|---|
| `let_winners_run` | none |
| `balanced` | flat-and-fading `weak_peak_cut 6h` · outer bound `hard_timeout 72h` |
| `mean_reversion` | flat-and-fading `weak_peak_cut 2h` · outer bound `hard_timeout 48h` |
| `scalp` | flat-since-entry `dead_weight_cut 45m` · outer bound `hard_timeout 90m` |
| `parabolic_runner` | outer bound `hard_timeout 336h` |

## When the ladder doesn't fit — offer, don't just warn

Every one of these ends in a concrete alternative the user can say yes to.

**First rung above ~40% ROE.** Most trades never get there, so the position runs its whole life with
nothing locked in. No shipped preset trips this — it catches hand-rolled ladders.
> "Your first lock is at +100%. A trade that peaks at +93% locks nothing and can ride all the way
> back down to your stop. `balanced` starts locking at +10%. Want that instead?"

**`lock_hw_pct: 0`.** Exits flat and still pays both sides of the fee, so a "scratch" is a loss.
Never ship one; there is no reading of the user's intent that this serves.

**Locks that shrink as triggers rise** (`50` then `30`). The ladder loosens as the trade wins, which
is backwards. Almost always a typo for the reverse order — read it back and ask.

**Preset against the thesis.** A fader on `let_winners_run`, a multi-day trend on `scalp`.
> "You described fading spikes, and those resolve in hours — `mean_reversion` banks at +5% instead of
> waiting for +20%."

If the user keeps their choice after you have explained it, build what they asked for. The rule is
that they choose knowingly, not that they choose what you would.
