# Hourly candles over 91 days, one request per coin, six at a time. It is the single most expensive
# step in the desk and it scales with how many names a book touches — which is unbounded. A wallet
# trading 174 coins asked for 187 candle pulls and the run was SIGTERM'd by the agent's exec timeout
# at "reading the tape: 120 of 187", having done all the work and produced nothing. Breadth is not a
# defect (a systematic book legitimately runs 80 names), so this caps the READ rather than refusing
# the book, and says in `meta` what it covered. (a live desk, 2026-09-23.)
MAX_TAPE_COINS = 60

# A market maker's desk is wrong in every line and expensive to produce. `userRole` catches the ones
# that are VAULTS; it returns `user` for a market maker quoting from a plain address, and those exist
# on the leaderboard today (`0x956a…`, 99% resting at 0.34 bp across 24 coins, role `user`).
#
# What separates them is not how much they rest. Measured over 7 days on 13 real wallets: HLP
# Strategy B — the one that actually burned a user session — is 41% maker, BELOW several ordinary
# traders, while a perfectly normal whale is 91% maker. Maker share would have missed the real one
# and refused a real reader.
#
# The fee rate was tried as that line and does NOT hold. (@im-vignesh, #763.) Hyperliquid PUBLISHES
# the schedule that produces a low rate: `userFees.feeSchedule.tiers.vip` sets the maker fee to
# 0.0 above $500M of 14-day volume, so effective = taker_share x 2.8bp and any patient limit trader
# at scale crosses 0.5 bp at ~18% taker share, on fees anyone can get. Re-sampled over the top 30 of
# the leaderboard by weekly volume, 25 wallets with >=200 perp fills:
#     -0.30 -0.25 -0.21 -0.10 -0.04 -0.02 0.05 0.11 0.15 0.21 0.24
#      0.42  0.50  0.57  0.78  0.79  1.04 1.23 1.24 1.36 1.54 1.89 2.37 2.47 2.82
# Nine sit inside the "structural gap" the earlier comment claimed; the distribution is continuous
# and 13 of 25 would have been refused, including VIP traders at 0.42 and 0.50 bp. The gap was an
# artefact of a 13-wallet sample.
#
# So the gate is no longer a CLASSIFIER of who someone is — a claim that can be false and insulting
# when it is. It is a statement about what this tool can do: the desk pulls hourly candles per coin
# and caps that read at MAX_TAPE_COINS. Past the cap it is scoring a SAMPLE of the book while
# printing a verdict about the book. That is the actual harm, it is measured rather than inferred,
# and it is true of a systematic trader on 200 names exactly as it is of a quoting engine — both
# deserve the same honest answer instead of an accusation.
#
# Measured on the same 29 wallets: the breadth line refuses 1 (115 coins, 5,514 fills/h) where the
# fee line refused 13. It still refuses the book that prompted this work (172 coins, 177 positions,
# 13,722 fills), and it serves every VIP trader the fee line wrongly turned away.
