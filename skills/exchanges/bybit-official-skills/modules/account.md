## Insufficient Balance — Transfer Guide

When an operation fails due to insufficient balance, assist the user by checking if funds are available elsewhere.

### Behavior

```
Operation fails: insufficient balance
    |
    v
Step 1: Check sub-account funding account
  ├── Has enough → inform user and ask if they want to transfer
  └── Not enough → continue
    |
    v
Step 2: Check master funding account
  ├── Has enough → inform user and ask if they want to transfer
  └── Not available → continue
    |
    v
Step 3: No available source found
  → Report insufficient balance only. No further guidance.
```

### Rules

1. Only check sub-account internal balance and master funding account.
2. If funds are found: inform user, wait for explicit transfer request before executing.
3. If no funds found or unable to determine: report "insufficient balance" only — no suggestions, no app links.
4. This guide does not modify existing transfer execution behavior. User-initiated transfers execute as normal regardless of source.

### Permission Error Handling

When a transfer fails due to permission restrictions, the permission name can be identified from the error response:

| retCode | Blocked Permission |
|---------|--------------------|
| 131234  | Transfer In        |
| 131235  | Transfer Out       |

Guide the user to enable the corresponding permission in App settings.

## Endpoint Notes

### Asset Overview (`/v5/asset/asset-overview`)
- Parameters updated: `category` and `coin` replaced by `accountType`, `memberId`, and `valuationCurrency`.
- **⚠️ `accountType` values are NOT the wallet-balance account types.** This endpoint uses its own naming — do NOT pass `UNIFIED` / `FUND` / `SPOT` / `CONTRACT` here (returns `3401405`). Comma-separated; if omitted, returns all account types.

  | Value | Meaning |
  |-------|---------|
  | `UnifiedTradingAccount` | Unified trading account. Always returned even at zero balance. Contains `CRYPTO` + optionally `STOCKS` categories |
  | `FundingAccount` | Funding account. Always returned even at zero balance |
  | `Earn` | Earn / financial products — has `categories` by product type |
  | `TradingBot` | Trading bot account — has `categories` by product type |
  | `CopyTrading` | Copy trading — has `categories` by product type |
  | `Alpha` | Alpha / Spot on-chain — has `categories` by product type |
  | `Launchpool` | Launchpool |
  | `CryptoLoans` | Fixed-rate crypto loans |
  | `CryptoLoans_legacy` | Legacy crypto loans |
  | `MarginStakedSOL` | Margin staked SOL |
  | `PayLater` | Pay later |
  | `TradFi` | TradFi / MT5 account |
  | `TRY_Savings` | TRY savings |

- `memberId` specifies a sub-account to query. If API key belongs to a sub-account, must match own UID or be omitted (otherwise `3401406`). Parent-account keys may specify any legal sub-account UID.
- `valuationCurrency` defaults to `USD` if not provided. If no market price exists for the requested currency → `3401408`.
- **Which accounts appear in `list[]`**: zero-balance accounts are filtered out, EXCEPT `UnifiedTradingAccount` and `FundingAccount` (always returned) or any account explicitly named in the `accountType` request param. Account types not enabled for the current site are excluded entirely.
- **`categories` vs top-level `coinDetail`** — they are mutually exclusive per account:
  - `UnifiedTradingAccount` → returns `categories` (`CRYPTO`, and `STOCKS` if the user holds DirectStocks; DirectStocks is merged into UTA, **not** returned as its own account type). Coin details live inside each category. **No top-level `coinDetail`.** `extMap` is stripped for UTA.
  - `Earn` / `TradingBot` / `CopyTrading` / `Alpha` → return `categories` where each category is a product-type name.
  - All other account types (`FundingAccount`, `Launchpool`, `CryptoLoans`, …) → return top-level `coinDetail`, no `categories`. `extMap` is included when non-empty.
- In the `STOCKS` category, `coinDetail[].coin` is the **stock symbol** (e.g. `AAPL`, `TSLA`), not a coin ticker.
- Zero-equity categories and zero-equity coins are filtered from the response.
- **`totalEquity` aggregation**: for `CopyTrading` and `TradFi`, negative equity is treated as `0` (it does not reduce the total).
- **Never branch on `retMsg`** — check `retCode == 0`. The spec example shows `retMsg: ""` but the live API returns `"Success"`; the value is not contractual.
- Error codes: `3401405` `accountType` illegal · `3401406` `memberId` not available · `3401407` account status abnormal / asset query failed · `3401408` valuation currency unavailable · `131001` internal invoke error (asset-argus) · `170130` invalid parameter data.

- `smpType` (SMP / Self-Match Prevention type): `0` unspecified — no SMP (default) | `1` cancel taker (maker stays) | `2` cancel maker (taker stays) | `3` cancel both. Note: `smpGroup` is deprecated and always returns `0`.
