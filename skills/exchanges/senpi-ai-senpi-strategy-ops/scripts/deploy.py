"""Deploy a strategy PACKAGE — a thin wrapper over the runtime's `openclaw senpi deploy` verb.

The runtime owns the whole go-live path now: funds preflight → wallet create+fund (with
skillName/skillVersion attribution) → runtime install → one observed scanner tick. It runs the
job DETACHED, so this script starts it and then polls `openclaw senpi deploy status` until the
job is terminal, relaying the verb's report VERBATIM. Nothing here re-derives a number, a
lifecycle claim, or a refusal string — the `[E_*]` codes pass straight through.

ONE refusal is repaired instead of relayed, and only one: a deploy refused because the package's
proof was recorded under a different runtime BUILD (`STALE_PROOF_REASON`). The runtime self-updates
in place, so every update invalidates every proof on the box at once, and relaying that would make
our own release cadence a fleet-wide deploy outage. The repair is `senpi validate` + ONE re-run —
see `stale_proof_dirs`, which keys on the gate's structured evidence, never on its wording.

  python3 deploy.py validate <id>                                  # preflight (no money, nothing installed; DOES fetch a bare id)
  python3 deploy.py create   <id> --budget <usd> [--max-wait S]    # run the deploy (create+fund+install+tick)
  python3 deploy.py runtime  <id> [--decision-model M]             # resume/complete the same deploy
  python3 deploy.py verify   <id>                                  # READ-ONLY: is it live? (deploys/fetches nothing)
  python3 deploy.py status   [<id>]                                # the last deploy job's status

TWO subcommands move money — `create` and `runtime` — and they drive the SAME idempotent verb:
re-running either resumes (the verb reconciles against the backend + the runtime registry and adopts
whatever exists), so they are one path under two names, not two steps. **`verify` is not one of
them.** It is the read-only check its name has always promised: a composite of `strategy_list` +
`openclaw senpi runtime list` + `openclaw senpi status --json` (plus a verbatim relay of the last
deploy job's `[W_*]` warns) that only QUOTES what it read. It starts no job, funds nothing, installs
nothing and FETCHES nothing (it resolves the package on disk only — downloading and writing one is a
side effect too) — so an agent following an old transcript ("just re-check it: deploy.py verify
spider") against a package whose funded wallet was deliberately left runtime-less cannot start it
trading. When something IS missing, verify NAMES the resume (`create`/`runtime`) and says what it will
do; it never runs it, and it never emits a teardown command. The step it names is chosen against the
state it actually READ: only an `ACTIVE` wallet is resumable, a transitional or teardown status
(`PAUSED`/`CLOSING_POSITIONS`, or a deploy still in flight) gets read-only triage, and a deploy job
already RUNNING for this package sends the reader to that job's report instead of a second dispatch.

Exit codes for `validate`/`create`/`runtime`/`status` mirror the verb's own (D-12): 0 live · 2
refused · 3 failed · 4 installed-unobserved · 5 interrupted · 6 pending (a wallet still funding, or
the job still running) · 1 internal/transport error. **2 is any gate saying no with nothing created
past it** — the verb's refusals, and this wrapper's own structural preflight (`validate`, and the
same pass the action subcommands run before the verb is started); both are deterministic and refuse
identically on a re-run.

**`verify` runs no job, so it returns none of that range beyond 0/3/1**: `0` verified (every instance
has an ACTIVE wallet AND a registered runtime AND its health read healthy) · `3` NOT verified (something
is missing or unhealthy — each instance says what, quoted, with the one non-destructive next step for
that actual state) · `1` COULD NOT CHECK (a read it needs failed). 1 is fail-closed and load-bearing:
an unreadable surface must never render as verified, and must never steer at the money path over a
package that may be perfectly live.

1 is also the fallback for a status this wrapper does not recognise, AND for a start we could not
follow (spawn failure, start timeout, or a 0-exit start that printed no deployId — in those last two
the job may well be running: read `openclaw senpi deploy status`; a runtime plugin that PREDATES the
verb is the opposite case — the CLI never parsed the command, so nothing was dispatched and the
message says to update the plugin instead), AND for a `status <id>` whose id is not the recorded
job's package, a `status` given `--ref` (it fetches nothing), or a `status` whose read produced NO
SNAPSHOT at all (the verb's own `[NOT_FOUND]`, or a failed read — relayed in the verb's words, never
restated here as an absence). In all of those the question could not be answered, no deploy outcome
is being reported, and re-running refuses identically. A `status` that DOES get a snapshot always
answers with that job's own D-12 code, however the `deploy status` call exited: its exit code is the
job's verdict, not a health signal about the call. There is no `cancel`: undeploying a strategy is
closing it (`close.py`), and a wedged job frees its own slot at the deploy deadline.

There is NO local deploy-state file any more. The backend strategies and the runtime registry ARE
the record — the sidecar `.deploy-state.json` was the source of the whole `E_STATE_*` lost-state
class, and it is gone. Package resolution (path or bare catalog id, with the remote fetch — which
`validate` runs too, so it is NOT side-effect-free: a bare id is downloaded and written under the
durable strategies root. `verify` is the only subcommand that resolves locally) and the structural
preflight stay here; the live-universe
gate and everything after them live in the
runtime (`[E_UNIVERSE_NOT_LIVE]`, pre-money, relayed verbatim like every other refusal). `validate`
still REPORTS the universe locally, from the same predicates the runtime ports — a report beside
the verdict, never the invariant.

def _no_deploy_job_answer(text):
    """True when the CALL'S OWN WORDS positively answer "no deploy job exists here".

    Two answers say it, and nothing else does. The verb's own `[NOT_FOUND]` refusal — no deploy has
    ever been started on this agent. And a CLI that REJECTED the command line (`_cli_rejected_the
    _command`): it never reached a gateway, so it is not running a verb job either. Precisely: the
    CLI PROCESS is not running one. The long-lived GATEWAY owns the job, and the two can disagree —
    if the whole plugin were missing from the CLI (`error: unknown command 'senpi'`, a token that IS
    ours) while the gateway still held it loaded with a job in flight, this would answer no-job
    wrongly. It cannot arrive here: `verify_reads` runs `openclaw senpi runtime list` and `senpi
    status --json` FIRST and a CLI with no `senpi` command fails both the same way, so verify has
    already returned could-not-check on the runtime-inventory read. That containment lives in the
    composite's read order, not in this function — anything that reorders those reads, or calls this
    without them, has to bring its own answer for the whole-plugin case. The narrower shapes this
    function is really for (verb absent, flag unknown) leave the rest of the CLI working, so they
    reach here with the inventory reads already answered. That second answer is fleet reality, not
    theory — skills update hourly from `main` while the runtime self-updates
    from npm on its own cadence, so during a rollout window a box legitimately has new skills and a
    pre-verb runtime. Reading it as unreadable made `verify` print COULD NOT CHECK (1) over a
    perfectly live strategy on every run, with a "re-reading is the answer" steer that can never
    come true there.

    Only ever given text the CLI produced — never a string this script composed about the answer:
    a synthesised description is not evidence, and scanning one for these shapes is how a detector
    starts matching its own prose.

    Everything else (a spawn failure, the STATUS_TIMEOUT, any other error) is a read that did not
    happen and stays could-not-check.

    Two guards keep the parse-error leg on the safe side of the money question, because here —
    unlike the start path, where nothing was dispatched whoever's parser spoke — a wrong "no job"
    lets the row name `create --budget` while a job may be funding a wallet:

      * the tokens must be OURS (`_status_argv`), so the verb's inner `gateway call` being rejected
        by an older openclaw is not read as our verb missing, and
      * an answer that mentions the `gateway call` round-trip at all is transport breakage by
        definition: the verb RAN, far enough to try the gateway. A box that has no verb never gets
        there.

    LATENT, and unreachable only by luck: a parse error naming a token of OURS cannot distinguish
    "no verb" from "verb present, that token unknown". It is safe today because `deploy status` and
    its `--json` shipped as one unit, so no released verb rejects either. The day ANY token is added
    to this read, a slightly-older verb answers with it — ours by token, no gateway text — and a
    RUNNING job classifies as no-job. A flag is only the obvious half: an added POSITIONAL produces
    `error: too many arguments for 'status'`, and `'status'` is ours too. Adding anything to this
    read means bringing a different discriminator with it (probe the verb, not the token)."""

    Three classifications, and the read is only ever one of them:

      * a **valid snapshot** (`_job_snapshot` — `state.status` present, the shape the verb emits),
      * a **positive no-job answer** (`_no_deploy_job_answer` — the verb's own `[NOT_FOUND]`, or a
        runtime with no `deploy` verb at all, which therefore has no verb job either),
      * anything else: the read did not happen. `ReadFailed` — never "no job".

    That last one is fail-closed on purpose. Every money steer this check emits is conditioned on the
    `running` bit, so a `deploy status` that simply did not answer must not let verify name
    `create`/`runtime` while a job may be funding the wallet at that moment. And the middle one is
    just as load-bearing in the other direction: mapping a no-verb box's unknown-command answer into
    could-not-check rendered a live, healthy package as uncheckable on every run.

    A package deployed before the verb legitimately has no job, so a no-job answer stays silent.
    There is one job record per agent and it is not package-addressed, so another package's job is
    skipped entirely: relaying polar's shortfall under a `verify spider` prompt is an invitation to
    bind the wrong package's numbers, and polar's running job says nothing about what spider's next
    step should be. A snapshot that names NO package cannot be sorted that way — so it is only safe
