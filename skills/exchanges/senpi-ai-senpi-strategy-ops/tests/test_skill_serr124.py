"""A backend `SERR124` (this account's pool of approved strategy wallets is empty — pools are per
account, and the code is seen on some migrated older accounts) is not a cause the agent can fix. The

into a 30-second retry loop, so the skill names it as the exception it is: tell the user, route it to
Senpi support, one later attempt after they confirm, never a loop, never a platform alert."""
