# Liveness Verification

When and how to verify a Senpi runtime is **actually operating**, not merely registered.

Use this whenever you have just deployed a strategy, are diagnosing a "nothing is happening" report, or
are about to tell the user a strategy is live. Do not declare success on `openclaw senpi runtime list:
running` alone — that field reports process status only, not functional liveness.

This is an **agent-side check**. Run the commands yourself; do not ask the user to confirm "is it working?"

> **Supervised model:** the runtime **spawns and supervises** each `external_scanner`, calling
> `scan(inputs, ctx)` every `interval_seconds` itself (restarting it on crash). There is **no separate
> producer daemon and no `push_signal`** — so there is nothing to reconcile against. **Never read the
> on-disk state files** (`/data/.openclaw/senpi-state/…`); they're internal, partially-written, and not a
> contract. The deploy report's `overall` carries this verdict at deploy time — re-read it read-only with

> could-not-check. It confirms an instance live only on an **ACTIVE** wallet: a
> `PAUSED`/`CLOSING_POSITIONS` one, or a deploy still in flight, is triage — never the resume. **The money path is the RESUME, `deploy.py runtime <id>`**
> (or `create <id> --budget <usd>`): that runs the deploy verb and can create, fund and install — never

## The contract: "running" ≠ "operating"

A runtime can show `status: running` while every component inside it is silent:

- A scanner can be mounted but never scheduled, or it threw on first init.
- The DSL monitor can be wired up while never evaluating a position.
- An action can be wired but never invoked because no signal ever reaches it.

Liveness means walking `openclaw senpi state -r <runtime_id> --json` and confirming each component is
doing real work, with timestamps and counters as proof. `runtime_id` = the runtime.yaml `name`
(`spider-swing`); rediscover a strategy's runtimes via `runtime list` matching `group == <id>`.

## Self-questions checklist

1. **Is the target runtime in `runtime list` with `status: running`?**
2. **Has its `external_scanner` executed at least once and recently** (a positive run count + a fresh
   `lastRunFinishedAt`)?
3. **Are its actions either operating or dormant-by-design** — never a wiring problem or failing?

**On DSL.** The DSL monitor exposes counters (`tickSuccessCount`, `lastTickFinishedAt`) in `state`, but
those only prove the internal tick loop moves — not that the end-to-end protective path (price providers,
MCP, exchange) works. Don't use DSL counters as a runtime-wide liveness gate; use `openclaw senpi dsl
inspect <ASSET>` when triaging a specific position.

## Field-level decision tree

Run `openclaw senpi state -r <runtime_id> --json` once, then walk each component. Use field paths against
the JSON structure — they are stable; the human-readable summary is not.

### The supervised external scanner

Path: the scanner entry under the runtime's scanners state (match on the `external_scanner` `name`, e.g.
`spider_swing_signals`).

A scanner is **operating** when the runtime says so — and for a **supervised external scanner** the
authoritative signals are `health` and the heartbeat, **not** the run counters:

- **`health ∈ {"healthy", "degraded"}`** — the runtime's own verdict (in **both** `status` and `state`).
  This is the primary signal; trust it. It is **fail-closed** and self-downgrading: `healthy` is earned
  (never painted on an unproven external scanner), **`unknown`** means "not yet proven by a tick" (wait /
  verify — not breakage), and a scanner that goes silent beyond ~2× its cadence is downgraded to
  `degraded` (≈4× → `unhealthy`) by the runtime itself, so staleness surfaces in `health` without you
  computing it.
- **`lastAliveAt` is fresh** (`now − lastAliveAt ≤ 2 × interval_seconds`) — the scanner POSTed to intake
  this cycle. **A healthy scanner that finds no setup still POSTs an empty heartbeat every tick**, so a
  live barren scanner has a fresh `lastAliveAt` even with **`runCount === 0` / no signals**. (For **hand
  triage** of an already-running strategy, check this freshness. The deploy-time gate — the verb's
  **observe** step — intentionally does **not** apply this 2×-cadence rule: staleness can't have accrued
  yet, so it asks only for a tick at or after *this* install and defers stall-detection to the runtime's
  own `health` verdict, which flips a silent scanner to `unhealthy`/`degraded`.)
- `enabled === true`, `consecutiveErrorCount === 0`, `lastError === null`.

> **Do NOT require `runCount > 0`.** For an external scanner, `runCount` and `lastRunFinishedAt` lag or
> stay `0`/`null` until the runtime has processed a POST, and a barren scanner legitimately emits no
> signals for long stretches. `runCount === 0` on its own is **never** breakage — it means "no trade this
> cycle," which is normal. Judge liveness by `health` + `lastAliveAt`; `runCount > 0` is a bonus, not a
> requirement.

Failure signatures (**positive** evidence of breakage only — anything else is "not yet confirmed," retry).
Note what this table structurally cannot tell you: a scanner that runs perfectly and *reads nothing*
emits no failure signature at all. That is what `senpi validate` is for, before the wallet exists.

| Symptom | Field signature | Likely cause |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime says it's broken | `health === "unhealthy"` (in `status` or `state`) | The runtime's own verdict — trust it; read `lastError` |
| Crash-looping | `health === "unhealthy"` with a restart count + cause on the scanner's own line in `status` | The supervisor is restarting a rapidly-failing scanner (it keeps retrying at capped backoff — restarts never stop on their own); fix the scanner code. Events carry `senpi.error.code: E_SCANNER_CRASH_LOOP` (tick failures: `E_SCANNER_TICK_ERROR` / `E_SCANNER_TICK_TIMEOUT`); read `lastError` for the cause |
| Repeatedly failing | `consecutiveErrorCount ≥ 1` or a persistent `lastError` | `scan()` is throwing — print `lastError`, `lastErrorAt` (usually an upstream MCP/RPC read in `scan()`) |
| Disabled | `enabled === false` | Scanner is turned off — not wired to run |
| Hung mid-tick | `inFlight === true` & `lastRunStartedAt` older than `timeout_seconds` | `scan()` exceeded its time box — the runtime kills + restarts it; persistent hangs point at a slow upstream read |
| Can't read either command | `state` throws AND `status` unreadable | **Not a scanner fault** — the gateway read is transiently unavailable (common right after deploy). Re-check; do not declare the scanner down. |
| **Healthy and doing nothing** | `health === "healthy"`, ticks land, `runCount` climbing — and **no signal ever accepted** | The hardest one to see from here: a scanner whose reads all fail, or that returns before reading, looks *identical* to one with no setups. Nothing in this table catches it, because there is no positive evidence to find. **Catch it before deploy** — `openclaw senpi validate <recipe-dir>` counts successful reads and reports **UNPROVEN** (exit 2) for a tick that established nothing. |

**When `status` and `state` disagree, `status` wins for the health verdict.** `status` (getHealthStatus)
keeps answering while `state` (getSystemState) is still throwing post-deploy — so a scanner that `status`
calls `healthy` **is** healthy even if `state` won't load yet. Use `state`'s raw fields (`lastAliveAt`,
`runCount`, `lastError`) only to *enrich* the verdict when the read succeeds, never to override a clean
`status` health with "state unreadable."

### Actions

Path: the actions state for the runtime.

Actions are reactive — `runCount === 0` is not always a failure. Disambiguate:

| Field signature | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `runCount === 0` AND the feeding scanner has `runCount > 0` and is emitting signals | **Wiring problem** — signals exist but the action never fires |
| `runCount === 0` AND the feeding scanner has not emitted signals yet | **Dormant by design** — not a failure |
| `runCount > 0`, `consecutiveErrorCount === 0`, `lastError === null` | **Operating** |
| `consecutiveErrorCount ≥ 2` or persistent `lastError` | **Failing** — print `lastError` |

For `decision_mode: llm` actions also check `totalDecisionsExecute` vs `totalDecisionsNoExecute`. A
runaway "no execute" rate is usually a prompt/threshold issue, not a runtime fault — surface it but don't
treat it as a liveness failure. (Rule-mode strategies like spider have no LLM decisions.)

## What "operating" means

Declare a strategy **live** only when, for **every** instance:

- `runtime list` shows its runtime as `running`;
- its `external_scanner` is `health ∈ {healthy, degraded}` (per `status`, and per `state` when it loads),
  `enabled`, `consecutiveErrorCount === 0`, `lastError === null` — with a fresh `lastAliveAt` when `state`
  is readable. **A barren scanner (`runCount === 0`, healthy, heartbeating) counts as live** — it is
  scanning, just not trading this cycle. A scanner reading **`unknown`** right after deploy is
  *live-but-unmeasured* (supervised, not yet proven by a tick — the fallback below applies); `unknown`
  persisting well past a couple of scan intervals means no tick has ever been proven — walk the `state`
  fields before declaring anything;
- each action is either "operating" or "dormant by design" — never "wiring problem" or "failing".

If you **cannot read `status` or `state`** for an instance (they're flaky-empty for a minute+ after start),
fall back to the **reliable backbone**: is the runtime in **`openclaw senpi runtime list`** as `running`?
If yes, the scanner is **live-but-unmeasured** (`supervised`) — the runtime spawns and supervises the
declared scanner and restarts it on crash, and the DSL protects positions — **not** "down." That is
hand-triage advice, not a verdict the tooling shares: the deploy verb's observe step reads an
unreadable scanner list as no tick and records `unobserved` → `overall: installed-unobserved`
(skipping observation must never read as verified), and `deploy.py verify` renders a running runtime
with no health entry as COULD NOT CHECK. Only a runtime **missing/stopped** in `runtime list`, one
showing **`running — NO ENTRY SCANNERS`** there (entry scanners never wired — check `senpi events`), or a
scanner the reads *positively* report unhealthy/erroring, is a real failure. Still: **never report a
strategy as live until a deploy report says `overall: live`** — read it with `openclaw senpi deploy
status`, which starts nothing.

Anything less: surface the specific failing field and the remediation, not a generic "looks fine." For
deeper engine triage (position_tracker → DSL → actions), see
`senpi-trading-runtime/references/runtime-concepts.md` and `openclaw senpi dsl|action …`.
