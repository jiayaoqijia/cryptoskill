"""senpi-trader-research engine — find copy candidates + vet a single trader (hidden, deterministic).

The agent (LLM) runs this via the OpenClaw `exec` tool, reads the JSON on stdout, and NARRATES a
trader read (see SKILL.md). The script does the data work — and the LLM does the analyst prose + CTAs.

Track record only says whether a trader is GOOD; it never says whether you can COPY them right now.
So FIND is mirror-aware by default: it enriches the top candidates with their live book, the PRICE
distance of each position from the trader's entry (what a mirror's slippage gates on), and 4h
momentum — and returns a `mirror_shortlist` ranked by copyability, not ROI.

  python3 research.py                          # find copy candidates — mirror-aware (top + mirror_shortlist)
  python3 research.py --trader 0xabc…          # due-diligence dossier on one trader
  python3 research.py --strategies             # top copy-trading strategies (mirror leaderboard)
  python3 research.py --time-frame ALL_TIME --sort-by WIN_RATE --limit 15
  python3 research.py --no-mirror              # track record only (skip the live-book enrichment)
