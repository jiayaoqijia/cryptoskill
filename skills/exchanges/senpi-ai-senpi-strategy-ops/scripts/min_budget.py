"""Canonical per-strategy minimum-budget calculation — PURE (no I/O, no yaml import).

VENDORED BYTE-IDENTICALLY into two skills:
  - senpi-trading-runtime/scripts/min_budget.py  (imported by gen_catalog.py -> bakes the
    number into catalog.json, which discovery reads at card time)
  - senpi-strategy-ops/scripts/min_budget.py     (the canonical reference copy; deploy.py
    imported it until deploy.py became a thin wrapper over `senpi deploy`, which now computes
    the number itself. Kept because this is the file the port cites and the checksum test pairs)
A checksum test (test_min_budget_vendor_parity) fails CI if the two copies drift.

A THIRD implementation exists, in ANOTHER REPO, that no test here can see:
Senpi-ai/senpi-trading-runtime `src/deploy/min-budget.ts` — the `senpi deploy` verb's port, which
computes this number for custom-authored packages that never pass through catalog generation.
CHANGING THIS FILE MEANS PORTING THE CHANGE THERE and re-running that repo's
`scripts/gen-min-budget-goldens.py` against this file to regenerate its parity goldens. The
checksum test below only guards the two copies in THIS repo; nothing fails if the TS port drifts.

WHAT IT IS. The smallest TOTAL strategy budget at which the design functions: every wallet
funds (>= the $10 platform floor) AND every wallet's SMALLEST slot can open at least the
engine's bumped-minimum notional ($12) at that slot's smallest marginPct and its LOWEST
leverage — i.e. worst case on BOTH axes, so even the least-leveraged, smallest-margin position
clears the floor.

    per_wallet_min = max( WALLET_FLOOR,  BUMPED_NOTIONAL / (marginPct/100 * min_leverage) + FEE_BUFFER )
    strategy_min   = max over wallets( per_wallet_min / funding_share )
                     floored at WALLET_FLOOR * wallet_count
                     rounded up to a clean step (STEPS); past the last rung, ceil to the next $25

Funding shares matter, not just wallet count: deploy splits the budget by share, so a small-
share sleeve must still receive its own per-wallet minimum -> it can DRIVE the total up.

The two platform constants deploy.py used to own (MIN_WALLET, FEE_BUFFER) live HERE now, so
there is one source of truth for the physics.
