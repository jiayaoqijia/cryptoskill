"""Offline engine test — runs review.run() against a recorded MCP fixture (no network).

The fixture reproduces the core scenarios the skill must get right:
  - SOL long: price FELL after the exit → holding would have lost → the exit BEAT holding (and it was a
    real DSL exit: a SL_TRIGGERED ratchet record at tier 2).
  - ETH long: price ROSE after the exit → holding would have made more → the exit was WORSE.
  - BTC SHORT: price FELL after the exit → a short GAINS when price falls, so holding would have made
    more → WORSE. This guards the direction sign for a short.
  - HYPE: a big mover the book never held → a book-vs-market GAP.
  - fail-open: a missing source degrades a field, not the whole run.
