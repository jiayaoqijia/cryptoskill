    The leaks each price a different fix over the SAME trades, so they must never be added — one bad
    trade that was oversized, chased, held too long AND gave back its peak appears in several of
    them. On a real book the four printed leaks summed to $68k against $65k of actual losses.

    This is the most conservative honest answer: **the single best change, applied to every trade.**
    Not a sum of fixes, and not the best fix per trade either — letting each trade pick its own lever
    is hindsight fitting at a finer grain, and a user runs one rule, not a different one per
    position. Each lever is a book-wide total that nets its own costs:

    * **exits** — every trailing-lock and time-cut setting, charged on the trades it would have hurt
      as well as the ones it saved.
    * **sizing** — a cap at the median winner's size across every oversized trade, winners included,
      where the term is negative because the cap gives up that upside.
    * **entries** — skipping chased entries, available only when this book's chased entries really
      did do worse than its calm ones, and worth only what the chase leak itself claims.

    Fees are added on top as the one genuinely independent fix. Funding is excluded: capping a
    funding-paying hold is the same action as the time-cut.

    Returns `concentration` alongside the total, because the shape matters as much as the size. On
    that same book three trades were 83% of it and one was 50% — "you leak $46k across your book"
    would have been true arithmetic and a false picture. `rule` is the finished sentence, not the
