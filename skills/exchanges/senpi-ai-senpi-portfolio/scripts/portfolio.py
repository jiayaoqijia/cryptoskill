"""senpi-portfolio engine — real-time wallet/balance taxonomy + holdings analysis (hidden).

The agent (LLM) runs this via the OpenClaw `exec` tool, reads the JSON on stdout, and NARRATES a
portfolio analysis (see SKILL.md). The script does the precise, real-time data work — enumerate every
wallet, classify every dollar into the right bucket, attribute positions, and pull market context for
analysis — and the LLM does the prose, the comparison, and the CTAs.

  python3 portfolio.py              # full real-time pull (all wallets + market context)
  python3 portfolio.py --no-market  # skip the per-asset market enrichment
  python3 portfolio.py --fixture f.json   # offline: recorded MCP-response map (tests)
  python3 portfolio.py --dry        # dump raw MCP responses for schema debugging

WHY THIS EXISTS — the balance-bucket trap:
Agents conflate `total_withdrawable` (free margin sitting INSIDE strategy wallets) with "idle cash in
the main embedded wallet." They are different buckets. This engine computes three structurally
separate pools so the agent never mixes them:
  1. idle_in_embedded   = total_in_hyperliquid + HL spot USDC + EVM token_balances   (truly free; deploy or withdraw)
  2. idle_in_strategies = sum of each strategy wallet's `withdrawable`      (in a strategy, not a position)
  3. deployed           = margin backing open positions
Grand total = idle_in_embedded + idle_in_strategies + deployed.

REAL-TIME, NEVER CACHED: account_get_portfolio caches HL data 12h unless forceFetch=true — this
engine always passes forceFetch. Per-strategy truth comes from live strategy_get_clearinghouse_state.

    ONE reader: the full read and the fast money map both build a row per wallet and must never name the
    same wallet two different things.

    `strategyName` first: it is the strategy's own name, and `deploy.py` creates it as `<id>-<instance>`,
    so it is the only field that tells one sleeve of a multi-wallet strategy from another.
    `tradingStrategyName` is NOT a second name — `strategy_list` sets it to `strategyMetadata.skillName`
    verbatim, so it is the PACKAGE id, identical across every instance of a package (three cub sleeves all
    render as "cub" through it) and already surfaced as `skill_name`.

    It stays in the chain as the fallback because `strategyName` is nullable BY MECHANISM: `strategy_create`
    takes no name at all and it is optional on `strategy_create_custom_strategy` (null on 21 of 23 rows in a
    live sample — the fallback is the COMMON path, not the edge case). For an unnamed strategy the package
    id is the most informative thing on the record; `"strategy"` is the last resort.

    Which is exactly why `name_source` is returned beside the name and rendered on every row: the name
    alone cannot tell "this strategy is called cub" from "this strategy is unnamed and cub is its package",
    and a surface that presents the second as the first is claiming a name it cannot prove. The source is
    the FIELD that answered, not a category, so it stays checkable against the payload. It also disambiguates
    the collision the fallback creates: a user-named `cub` and an unnamed strategy from package `cub` both
    render `name: "cub"`, and only `name_source` separates them.

    No `shortTraderAddress` leg. `strategy_list` DOES carry the field — the MCP maps every row through
    `withShortTraderAddress` — but it is the masked OG *trader* address (a copy-trade lineage), empty for

    'unknown' is NOT PROVEN LIVE — telemetry unavailable, or the runtime itself says it can't vouch for

    verdict renders `unknown`). It is never asserted as broken and never upgraded to 'live': the runtime

    `unknown` as 'live' here would re-open exactly the fail-open it closes. Registered-vs-not-running is
    the registry read's verdict, not this one's — telemetry that reports nothing may neither upgrade a
    strategy to running nor condemn it.

    Reads the verdict ONLY from a record's own top level — NOT via a deep search. A deep search would
