# Detector library — senpi-signals

Each detector is one of the scanner families the 100+ templates already use, run in **observe mode**.
For every detector: the MCP source, the fields, the threshold, the normalized signal it emits, and
the human framing. **Confirmed** = response shape verified; **VERIFY-LIVE** = call the tool once and
read the real response before writing extraction (KeyError > silent zero).

> **2.0 scope — one reading, no compare.** `scripts/sweep.py` runs `score.py` without `--state`, so no
> earlier reading exists. **In 2.0:** `sm_divergence` (the standing state; its *flip* is v2),
> `funding_extreme`, `momentum_event`, `cross_asset_laggard`. **v2, because each needs an earlier
> reading:** `oi_surge`, `sm_conviction`, `funding_flip`, `sm_positioning_build`, `sm_flow`,
> `whale_move` (`score.HISTORY_DETECTORS`). Their sections below document the v2 engine; 2.0 never fires them.

## The normalized signal schema
Everything downstream (scoring, framing) consumes this one shape:
```json
{
  "asset": "OIL",                     // exact HL instrument (case-sensitive; xyz: prefix for stocks)
  "dex": "" ,                          // "" = main HL, "xyz" = xyz DEX
  "detector": "oi_surge",             // see families below
  "direction": "long",                // "long" | "short" | null
  "numbers": ["OI +10% (1h)", "price flat"],   // the cited facts, each from a real read
  "notional_vol": 4200000,            // liquidity → the credibility MULTIPLIER (not a filter)
  "price_change_pct": -3.1,           // 4h % move — powers the trade lens's price-confirmation term
  "concrete_entity": null,            // a public 0x… wallet when the signal is about one trader
  "magnitude": 0.10                   // normalized size the scorer reads (see each detector)
}
```
`score.py` adds the rest per signal: `detector` (splitting funding into flip/extreme), `conflict`,
`flip`, `is_change`, and the outputs `credibility`, `freshness`, `trade_score`, `social_score`. You
supply the metrics; it supplies the scoring.

Diff-based detectors (OI, smart-money, funding) are fired *inside* `score.py` from `asset_metrics` +
the prior snapshot — you supply the metrics, not the signal. Event-based detectors (whale, momentum,
cross-asset) you assemble as pre-formed `events[]`.

## What `scripts/sweep.py` supplies (2.0 — the gather is the script's job, not yours)

One process gathers every field below and hands `current.json` to `score.py`; the agent never
assembles it. Per asset (top-N of `market_list_instruments` by day notional volume, both dexes):

| field | source (one read unless noted) | note |
|---|---|---|
| `oi`, `price`, `price_change_pct_24h`, `notional_vol`, `dex` | `market_list_instruments` → `context` (`openInterest`, `markPx`, `prevDayPx`, `dayNtlVlm`) | `oi` is **base units** — immune to the price move |
| `funding_annualized_pct`, `funding_pctile` | same read → `context.funding` (HL's **hourly** rate × 24 × 365 × 100); percentile = cross-sectional rank of \|annualized\| inside this universe | a flip needs an earlier reading (v2) |
| `smart_source: proven_cohort`, `smart_share_kind: cohort_pct`, `smart_dir`, `smart_share`, `smart_long_n`, `smart_short_n`, `cohort_n`, `smart_positions`, `smart_net_bias`, `smart_net_usd` | senpi-smart-money's `build_cohorts` (1 page of `discovery_get_top_traders`, ALL_TIME realized ≥ $1M, 150 sampled) + `cohort_bias` (`discovery_get_trader_state`, 3 batches of 50) — **imported unchanged** | `smart_dir` = the headcount majority; `smart_share` = majority ÷ `cohort_n` × 100; `smart_positions` = `{wallet: signed szi}` from the same batches (no extra read). The engine's notional `bias`/`net` ride along as colour, never as the basis |
| `crowd_dir` + `crowd_source`, `hot_4h_share`, `hot_4h_dir`, `hot_4h_trader_count`, `price_change_pct` (4h) | `leaderboard_get_markets` (limit 500): the dominant row per token | `crowd_source: board_4h` when the name is on the board, else `funding_sign` (positive ⇒ crowd LONG). `price_change_pct` is absent off-board — `earliness` then scores neutral, honestly |
| `events[]` `momentum_event` | `leaderboard_get_momentum_events` (limit 50, last 4h): only `decision: sent` (the platform's own "worth notifying" gate); the largest `top_positions` leg; `concrete_entity` shortened `0x12…ab34`; `age_minutes` from `detected_at` | the platform's whale feed — replaces per-wallet reads |
| `events[]` `cross_asset_laggard` | `market_get_cross_asset_flows` (BTC, 2%, 4h): laggards with `follow_rate ≥ 0.8` | direction = the leader's |
| `whale_move` *(in score.py)* | the same `discovery_get_trader_state` books, diffed per wallet against the previous sweep's snapshot | **v2** — 2.0 keeps no previous snapshot, so it never fires; `leaderboard_get_trader_positions` carries only a 4h P&L delta, which is not a move |

`current.json` also carries `coverage` (per source: `ok (…)` / `failed: <tool>: <err>` / `NO DATA` /
`unavailable`), `source_trader_count`, `reads` and `reads_failed`. A read that fails
degrades its fields for that run and is named there — it never crashes the sweep.

## Diff-based detectors (fire in score.py from asset_metrics vs prior snapshot)

### 1. `oi_surge` — open-interest build / OI-price divergence  *(oi-tracker family)* — **v2**
- **Source:** open interest per asset. **VERIFY-LIVE:** HL Info API `metaAndAssetCtxs` →
  `openInterest` per asset (the template scanners in `strategies/*/main/scanners/scan.py` read this;
  copy their extraction). Price from `market_get_prices` / `market_get_asset_data` (candles keyed
  `o/h/l/c/v` as **strings**).
- **Metric fields:** `oi`, `price`.
- **Fires when:** `(oi − prior_oi)/prior_oi ≥ 0.10`. If `|price change| < 1%` at the same time →
  tag it OI-price **divergence** (positioning building with no price move — a conflict bonus).
- **Why non-obvious:** OI is invisible on a price chart. Magnitude = the OI %.
- **Framing:** `OI +10% on <ASSET> <longs|—> while price sat flat.`

### 2. `sm_divergence` — smart money vs the crowd  *(smart-money + divergence families)* — **2.0** (the flip: v2)
- **Source — the proven cohort, NOT the leaderboard.** Smart-money *direction* = **senpi-smart-money**
  engine (the **≥$1M-lifetime-realized** cohort's **net positioning**: bias, members, **net $**, crowd
  side, divergence flag — it already computes all of this; consume it). **Do NOT derive smart-money
  direction from `leaderboard_get_markets` `pct_of_top_traders_gain`** — that's the *live-4h*
  leaderboard cohort (momentum / survivorship-biased: for a rising asset the "top traders" are just
  whoever's long it). Confusing the two is what makes senpi-signals contradict the pulse read (e.g.
  proven cohort net-**short** HYPE while the 4h winners ride HYPE longs). Crowd side: from
  senpi-smart-money, or the funding-sign proxy (positive ⇒ crowd LONG, negative ⇒ crowd SHORT).
- **Metric fields:** `smart_dir`, `crowd_dir`, `smart_share`, **`smart_source`** — and, whenever you
  can get them, the **positioned split** `smart_long_n` / `smart_short_n` (+ optional `cohort_n`).
- **⚠️ `smart_source` is mandatory in practice.** The engine will not assert a provenance it wasn't
  given: it picks the output wording *and* a trust multiplier from this field.

  | `smart_source` | printed as | trust |
  |---|---|---|
  | `proven_cohort` | "the proven cohort" / "Smart money" | 1.0 |
  | `leaderboard_4h` | "the live 4h leaderboard (what's winning now, not track record)" | 0.7 |
  | *(omitted)* | "top traders (**SOURCE UNSTATED — do not call this smart money**)" | 0.8 |

  Trust multiplies into `credibility`, exactly as thin liquidity does — two independent reasons to
  believe a reading less. This exists because the failure is silent otherwise: feed the 4h board in,
  read "smart money is short HYPE" out, and post a survivorship artefact as conviction.
- **⚠️ EXACT mapping from `senpi-smart-money` (read from `scripts/smartmoney.py`, do not improvise).**
  Its `smart_leaning[]` entries carry `bias`, `direction`, `members`, `n_long`, `n_short`, `net_usd`:

  | smartmoney field | what it actually is | maps to |
  |---|---|---|
  | `bias` | **`net / gross` NOTIONAL in [−1,+1]** — dollar-weighted and **signed**; `+1` = all long | `smart_share = abs(bias)*100` **with `smart_share_kind: "net_bias"`** |
  | `direction` | `_dir(bias)` — long/short/flat | `smart_dir` |
  | `n_long` / `n_short` | **headcounts of positioned traders** | `smart_long_n` / `smart_short_n` |
  | `members` | `n_long + n_short` — traders *positioned in this coin*, **not** the cohort size | (use for the split) |
  | `cohorts.smart.members_sampled` | the cohort sample (≤ `SAMPLE_CAP` 150) | denominator for `cohort_pct` |

  **`sweep.py` declares `cohort_pct`** (headcount: `max(n_long, n_short) / members_sampled`), and carries
  `bias` alongside as `smart_net_bias` — colour, not the basis.
  **`bias` is NOT a headcount percentage.** Rendering `bias = −0.83` as "83% of the proven cohort hold
  shorts" is a false claim about a different quantity — the true statement is "net exposure is 83%
  short-weighted". Declare **`smart_share_kind`** (`"net_bias"` | `"cohort_pct"`) and the engine words
  it correctly; omit it and every line prints "**BASIS UNSTATED**".
  **The gates are per-basis and not interchangeable:** `net_bias` must clear **40** (matching
  smartmoney's own `LEAN_THRESHOLD = 0.40` — never call a lean directional when the engine that
  computed it wouldn't), while `cohort_pct` clears at **8** (12 of 150 members on one name out of ~200
  instruments is already rare). Note smartmoney also enforces `MIN_MEMBERS = 5` before it trusts a bias.
- **`smart_share` is the share on `smart_dir` from the source you declared** — the cohort % for
  `proven_cohort`, the leaderboard share for `leaderboard_4h`. Never carry one and label it the other.
  If you have a proven-cohort read *and* want the 4h number alongside it, put the latter in
  **`hot_4h_share`** as labelled colour — never as the divergence's headline.
- **⚠️ The positioned split is what makes a lean directional.** `smart_share` alone can't tell a rout
  from noise: 43%-of-cohort short is **429 vs 40** (~91% one-sided → real conviction) or **429 vs 380**
  (~53% → noise). Pull both sides' counts (the senpi-smart-money engine has them; or sum sides from
  `leaderboard_get_trader_positions`). `one_sidedness = short_n / (short_n + long_n)` — score.py reads
  it when both are present and reports it in `numbers`. **Without it, report the split as unknown; do
  not imply the un-positioned remainder is on the other side** (see SKILL golden rule 8).
- **⚠️ SAMPLE SIZE governs how much the lean counts.** `4 short vs 1 long` and `400 vs 100` are both
  "80% one-sided" — one is a fact about the market, the other is four people. The observed ratio is
  shrunk toward 50/50 by `n/(n + SAMPLE_PRIOR_N)` before it drives magnitude (n=5 → 0.20 weight,
  n=20 → 0.50, n=469 → 0.96). **The reported figures stay raw and honest** — shrinkage governs the
  *score*, never the *facts* — and at `n ≤ SMALL_SAMPLE_N` (10) the output appends
  "**SMALL SAMPLE (n=…), treat as weak evidence**" so the reader sees it without inferring it.
- **Fires when:** `smart_dir != crowd_dir` AND `smart_share` clears **its basis's gate** (net_bias 40 / cohort_pct 8 / unstated 25). Flip bonus if `prior.smart_dir`
  existed and differs (smart money *just* shifted). Conflict bonus (it's a divergence).
- **crowd_dir (how to get it, in order):** (1) HL OI long/short split per asset (VERIFY-LIVE
  `metaAndAssetCtxs`); (2) **funding sign** as a live proxy — positive funding ⇒ crowd LONG, negative
  ⇒ crowd SHORT. **Divergence = the smart dominant direction *opposite* crowd_dir.** Smart-long-while-
  price-*down* is NOT a divergence (that's smart-vs-price) — don't call it one.
- **Framing** (the lead phrase follows `smart_source` — "Smart money" only for `proven_cohort`):
  `<Smart money|The last 4h's top performers> lean <SHORT> on <ASSET> — <X>% of <source> (<S> short vs
  <L> long among those positioned, <O>% one-sided), ~$<Nm> notional — while the crowd is <LONG>.`

### 2b. `sm_positioning_build` — the cohort's positioning MOVING  *(smart-money family — the best signal we have)* — **v2**
**This is the flagship read: change, applied to the highest-quality data.** A *standing* divergence is
a state ("smart money is short X"); this is the **same cohort shifting onto a side over ~12h** — the
thing that is actually news. It outranks a standing divergence by design (change bonus + top edge).
- **Source:** the same proven-cohort read as #2, **diffed against the ~12h snapshot in the state ring**
  (`TREND_LOOKBACK_MIN`). The ring keeps ~25h, so the long arm always has a partner once warm.
- **Metric fields:** `smart_dir`, `smart_share` (cohort %), plus the same optional `smart_long_n` /
  `smart_short_n`. **You supply only the current reading** — score.py finds the 12h-ago value itself.
- **Fires when:** `smart_dir` is UNCHANGED vs ~12h ago (a genuine build on one side, not a rotation)
  AND `|smart_share − smart_share_12h| ≥ TREND_MIN_PP` (3pp) **AND the baseline is genuinely old —
  `≥ TREND_MIN_AGE_MIN` (6h).** Rising = building, falling = unwinding.
- **⚠️ The baseline is matched PER ASSET and PER SOURCE.** The ring is heterogeneous — an asset may be
  newly listed, and a given sweep may or may not have run the proven-cohort engine. So the detector
  searches the ring for the snapshot nearest the ~12h arm that holds *this asset* with *the same*
  `smart_source`. **It will not diff across a source switch:** comparing a proven-cohort reading now
  against a leaderboard reading 12h ago manufactures a "trend" out of a change of *instrument*, not of
  positioning. Practical consequence: **changing `smart_source` restarts that asset's trend history** —
  the detector goes quiet until ~12h of the new source accumulates. Pick a source and keep it.
- **⚠️ It narrates the baseline's REAL age, and refuses a young one.** `_pick_baseline` falls back to
  the oldest snapshot it has, so on a cold ring that can be *minutes* old. Firing then — and printing
  "~12h ago" over a 20-minute diff — fabricates the window (golden rule 1). Below the minimum age it
  simply does not fire; the run JSON reports `trend_baseline_age_hours` and `trend_ready` so you can
  see *why* it stayed quiet rather than guessing.
- **Magnitude:** `|Δpp| / 15` capped at 1 — a 15pp swing in 12h is enormous.
- **Why it beats everything else:** it needs *history of the cohort*, which nobody else keeps. A price
  chart can't show it, the 4h leaderboard can't show it, and a single-run snapshot can't show it.
- **Framing:** `<ASSET> <side>s are what to watch — <X>% of the proven cohort now hold <SIDE> positions,
  up from <Y>% ~12h ago (<+Npp>), <O>% one-sided among those positioned.`
- **Requires a warm ring:** on a cold state file there is no 12h partner, so it stays quiet — that is
  expected, not a bug. **This is the single strongest argument for running the sweep on a schedule.**

### 2c. `sm_flow` — money that actually MOVED IN, in BASE UNITS  *(smart-money family — the cleanest read)* — **v2**
**Everything above measures HOLDINGS. This measures DECISIONS.** It is the only detector immune to
the circularity that contaminates every other smart-money read.

**⚠️ Why it exists — read this before using any smart-money signal.** The 4h gain leaderboard is
*circular*: if SPCX falls, every wallet short SPCX is mechanically at the top. The board is a
**consequence** of the move, never evidence anyone predicted it. And a *notional* lean (`net_bias` =
net/gross notional) carries the same bug one level down — if a name falls 10% and **nobody trades at
all**, every short's notional grows and every long's shrinks, so the lean drifts toward the winning
side on price alone. Base units cannot do that: a wallet either opened the position or it didn't.

- **Source:** the same proven-cohort fan-out as #2 / #2b, but keep the **position sizes**, not just
  the direction. Diffed against the ~12h snapshot in the ring, resolved per asset and per source
  exactly as #2b is.
- **Metric field:** **`smart_positions` = `{wallet: signed BASE size}`** — coins/contracts,
  `+` long / `−` short. **NOT notional, and not USD.** If the venue gives you notional, divide by
  the mark before you pass it. You supply only the current reading; score.py finds the 12h-ago one.
- **Fires when:** `opened + added ≥ FLOW_MIN_WALLETS` (3 distinct wallets) **AND** base units held
  on the side grew by `≥ FLOW_MIN_BASE_PCT` (+10%) **AND** the baseline is `≥ TREND_MIN_AGE_MIN` old.
- **Reports:** wallets that **OPENED** (flat → positioned), **ADDED** (size grew), **CLOSED**
  (positioned → flat), and the % growth in base units on the side. Every one of those is a decision.
- **Missing `smart_positions` ⇒ it cannot fire at all** — and that is *not* the same as finding
  nothing. Check `coverage.flow_lens` (`ok` / `thin` / `NO DATA`) in the run JSON before reporting a
  quiet result as a null result.
- **Voice:** *"4 wallets OPENED and 1 ADDED SHORT in the last ~14h; base size on the side +408%
  (units, not notional — immune to the price move); crowd still LONG."* Not who is winning right
  now — who is buying in.

### 3. `sm_conviction` — a SHARP, short-horizon conviction jump  *(smart-money family)* — **v2**
- **Same `smart_share` field as #2/#2b (the proven-cohort share), diffed on the FAST (~1h) baseline.**
  The three smart-money detectors are one metric on three horizons: #2 the standing *state*, **#3 a
  sharp ~1h move (≥12pp — rare and abrupt)**, #2b the ~12h *trend* (≥3pp — the usual story). Only one
  per asset survives the per-family dedup, so the strongest horizon wins.
- **The 4h leaderboard number is NOT this.** If you carry `pct_of_top_traders_gain`, it goes in
  `hot_4h_share` as labelled color ("what's hot in the last 4h") — never as a conviction claim, and
  never into `smart_share`. Don't headline a single 4h wiggle: require persistence across reads or a
  durable corroborator before featuring it.
- **Source:** the proven-cohort read (senpi-smart-money), diffed vs the fast prior snapshot.
- **Metric fields:** `smart_share`, `trader_count`.
- **Fires when:** `|smart_share − prior.smart_share| ≥ 12` points — **both directions**: a jump = top
  traders **piling in**, a drop = top traders **unwinding / exiting** (the BTC-exodus case is a real
  signal, not noise). Always state which flow *and* the side (long/short).
- **One source per field.** If you have a first-run-capable pp-change from the API, use it *or* the
  state-diff — never both. (A "+57pp to 56%" that implies a negative prior means the two got mixed.)
- **Framing:** `Top traders are <piling into|unwinding> <ASSET> <LONG|SHORT> — concentration <+/−>Npp to <share>%.`

### 4. funding — split into a CHANGE and a STATE detector  *(funding family — the biggest, and the noisiest)* — `funding_extreme` **2.0**, `funding_flip` **v2**
The old single `funding_dislocation` flooded the feed because a *static* extreme re-fires every run.
Split it: a **flip is a change** (tradeable — the carry regime just turned) and an **extreme is a
state** (great content, but not a directional edge). `score.py` fires whichever applies.
- **Source (partly Confirmed):** `market_get_funding_history` (asset) → 8h rate, annualized %,
  funding_direction (who collects), persistence, trend; `market_get_funding_regime`. (Needs a
  market-scoped token — it 401s on an under-scoped one; then skip this detector, don't fake it.)
- **Metric fields:** `funding_pctile` (0–100), `funding_annualized_pct`, and the **prior**
  `funding_annualized_pct` (from the snapshot) so a sign flip is detectable.
- **`funding_flip`** — fires when `sign(funding_annualized_pct)` flipped vs the prior snapshot. A
  *change* → high trade + social score. Framing: `Funding on <ASSET> flipped to <±annualized%>/yr — the carry regime turned.`
- **`funding_extreme`** — fires when `funding_pctile ≥ 95` (and it didn't flip). A *state* → strong
  **social** score (non-obvious trivia), **low trade** score (carry, not a directional edge). Framing:
  `<ASSET>: <pctile>th-percentile funding, <±annualized%>/yr — a dislocation most screens never show.`

## Event-based detectors (assemble as pre-formed `events[]`)

### 5. `whale_move` — a proven wallet *just moved* (a change, not a holding)  *(whale / position_tracker)* — **v2**
- **The whole point is the MOVE, not the holding.** A whale *sitting on* a big position — even a
  $78M one — is **not a signal** if it's been held since an old entry and hasn't changed. "0x… holds
  $78M HYPE long" tells a reader nothing they can act on: they may have opened it months ago and just
  ridden it. What's noteworthy is a **recent change** or a **sudden P&L swing** — that's news; a
  static book is not. **Never emit a whale_move for a position that only *exists* and is large.**
- **Fires only on ONE of:**
  1. **A recent size change** — opened / added / trimmed / **flipped** ≥ ~$1M (or ≥ ~25% of the book)
     **this window**. Set `change_usd` (signed Δnotional) and/or `opened: true` / `flipped: true`.
  2. **A sudden P&L swing** — the position moved ≥ ~$1M **in the last 4h** (a winner suddenly bleeding,
     a loser ripping). Set `pnl_swing_usd`. This catches "an old position that's *now* in motion."
  `score.py` **drops any whale_move that carries none of** `change_usd / pnl_swing_usd / opened /
  flipped` — a bare holding never scores. Magnitude comes from the **change**, not the position size.
- **Recency is required in the framing.** Say **when / how fresh**: "opened today", "added in the last
  4h", "flipped from long to short this window". If you can only tell that it's *large* and *old* (the
  entry price sits far from the recent range and nothing changed), it's a holding — **skip it**.
- **Source:** the proven cohort's books — the `discovery_get_trader_state` reads the sweep already makes.
  `score.py` diffs each wallet's **base size** per asset against the previous sweep's snapshot and fires
  on an open, an add or a flip worth ≥ `WHALE_MIN_USD` at today's price; trims and closes are not
  entries. A wallet the previous snapshot never sampled is skipped (it may be new to the sample, not
  new to the trade). `leaderboard_get_trader_positions` returns each position's **4h P&L delta but no
  size delta**, so it cannot show a move on its own — use it in focus mode on a named wallet. A first
  run has no previous snapshot, so nothing fires; "no notable whale moves" is a correct, honest answer.
- **`concrete_entity`** = the public `0x…`. **Framing (lead with the change + when):**
  `A top trader (0x12…) just grew their <ASSET> SHORT by $10M to $50M (added this 4h window).`
  or `0x12… flipped <ASSET> long→short today — now $30M short.` Include the entry only as context
  for the *change*, never as the headline of a static hold.

### 6. `cross_asset_laggard` — rotation not yet priced in  *(cross-asset family)* — **2.0**
- **Source:** `market_get_cross_asset_flows` (meaningful only when BTC moved >2% in 4h; `follow_rate`).
- **Framing:** `BTC ran <x%> but <ASSET> hasn't followed (follow-rate <r>) — the laggard.`

### 7. `momentum_event` — the platform's own tiered events  *(momentum family)* — **2.0**
- **Source:** `leaderboard_get_momentum_events` (tiers + behavioral tags + notification decisions —
  it already scores "is this worth notifying"). Pass through the high-tier ones as events.

### 8. `regime_shift` — sector/asset regime flip  *(regime family)*  *(v1: optional / focus mode)*
- **Source:** the regime read (bull/bear/range/event-driven) from weekly-daily structure; flag flips.

---

## Framing rules (apply to every signal)
- **Direction is mandatory** — LONG or SHORT, plus the flow for OI/conviction (building/unwinding).
  A surge with no side is useless. Unknown side → say "side unresolved" + pull the OI split.
- **Quantify: % of cohort + $ notional + % of PnL** — never a raw "44 traders". Say
  "**X% of the proven traders are short GOOGL — ~$204M notional — and Y% of their open PnL**".
  X = `trader_count / source_trader_count`; **$** = sum of the cohort's *actual* position notional on
  that asset+side (VERIFY-LIVE via `leaderboard_get_trader_positions`; surface it for featured
  signals; **never estimate — omit if you can't sum a real figure**). Keep the headcount-% distinct
  from the PnL-concentration-% (`pct_of_top_traders_gain`).
- **Name the asset — never a bare ticker.** Assume the reader has never heard of it. One clause on
  *what it is*: "ACE (a low-cap gaming alt)", "ZEC (Zcash, a privacy coin)", "OIL (crude oil, an xyz
  perp)". A ticker + a % with no idea what the thing is can't be judged noteworthy. Well-known majors
  (BTC/ETH/SOL/HYPE) need no gloss. Source the descriptor from `market_list_instruments` metadata or
  common knowledge; if you genuinely don't know what it is, say so rather than posting it blind.
- **Price context on positioning signals.** A divergence or whale move needs price to hang on: the
  recent move (e.g. "−6% today, −18% on the week") and *where price sits* (near range low/high, a
  round level). Positioning without price is half a signal — pull `market_get_asset_data` candles.
- **Define the jargon inline** — never "the leaderboard", "top traders", "4h window", or "% of
  top-trader PnL" without a plain-English gloss the first time (see Glossary below).
- **Weight by size; lead with the robust facts.** Lead with what a sharp reader can independently
  check (price move + volume, OI building/draining); use thin positioning (few traders, low %,
  tiny market) as *corroboration*, never the headline. Never upgrade "leans short (1.23%)" to
  "smart money is short." See `worked-examples.md` (WLFI).

### Glossary (use these plain-English definitions in output)
- **Top traders / the cohort** — the top ~C most-profitable traders on Hyperliquid by realized PnL
  (`source_trader_count` from `leaderboard_get_markets`) — "the proven money," not "everyone."
- **The leaderboard** — `leaderboard_get_top` = Hyperliquid's *live 4-hour rolling* board
  ("Predators"); `discovery_*` = historical track record. Always say **which**.
- **4h window** — the last four hours (the live leaderboard's rolling window).
- **Cohort headcount %** (`trader_count / source_trader_count`) — what share of the proven cohort
  holds this position: "44% of the top traders are short X." Distinct from % of top-trader PnL below.
- **Aggregate notional $** — the dollar size of the cohort's combined position on an asset+side,
  summed from their actual positions (`leaderboard_get_trader_positions`): "~$204M in GOOGL shorts."
  Real summed figure only — never estimated.
- **% of top-trader PnL** (`pct_of_top_traders_gain`) — of all the open profit that cohort is holding
  right now, the share sitting in this one token+side. High = the proven money is concentrated there.
- **Concentration jump/drop** (`contribution_pct_change_4h`) — how much that share moved vs 4h ago.

## Ways to play (the closing question — never in public/tweet copy)
Per detector, the thesis behind SKILL.md's closing question (a trade via senpi-trade; or a strategy:
Athena or the read's own template via senpi-strategy-ops, or the user's own via senpi-strategy-author,
per SKILL.md's table), always shown with its size and stop first and executed only on the user's yes:
- `sm_divergence` → **align with the smart-money side** (or fade the crowd).
- `sm_conviction` piling-in → **follow the crowding**; unwinding → **de-risk / fade**.
- `whale_move` → **mirror the whale** (senpi-trade mirror) at your budget, with a stop.
- `funding_flip` / `funding_extreme` → **harvest the funding** — take the side that *collects*, sized for the carry.
- `oi_surge` / `cross_asset_laggard` → position for the build / the catch-up.
Observation stays public; the play stays private.

## Dual-lens scoring (in score.py — keep in sync)
Every signal is scored **twice** — a `trade_score` for users building ideas and a `social_score` for
the content automation — then each feed is ranked, family-capped, and diffed independently.

```
social = 100 × credibility × freshness × (0.34·non_obvious + 0.22·magnitude + 0.20·conflict + 0.14·change + 0.10·concrete)
trade  = 100 × credibility ×            (0.30·edge        + 0.22·confirmation + 0.18·change + 0.16·conflict + 0.14·magnitude)
```
The terms:
- **non_obvious** (social moat, per detector): `sm_positioning_build, oi_surge, funding_flip,
  sm_divergence, whale_move` = 1.0;
  `funding_extreme` = 0.9; `sm_conviction` = 0.85; `cross_asset_laggard` = 0.8; `momentum_event, regime_shift` = 0.6.
- **edge** (trade actionability, per detector): `sm_positioning_build` = 1.0 (proven traders *moving*
  onto a side — the strongest read we have); `sm_divergence` = 1.0; `sm_conviction` = 0.9;
  `whale_move` = 0.85; `oi_surge, cross_asset_laggard` = 0.75; `funding_flip` = 0.7;
  `momentum_event, regime_shift` = 0.6; **`funding_extreme` = 0.35** (carry, not a directional edge).
- **magnitude:** normalized 0–1 (OI% ×2; funding_pctile/100; smart_share/100; whale change_$/$10M; capped 1).
- **conflict:** a divergence (`sm_divergence`; the OI-price-flat flavor of `oi_surge`) = 1, else 0.
- **change:** the signal fired from a *diff* vs the baseline (a flip / surge / jump / delta), not a
  static level. `funding_extreme` is the one big state detector (change = 0).
- **concrete:** `concrete_entity` set (a named wallet) = 1, else 0.3.
- **confirmation** (trade only): is price moving *with* the signal's direction? long+up / short+down
  → up to 1.0 (a working setup); the opposite → toward 0 (early/contrarian); no direction → 0.5.
  ~3% 4h move = full confirmation. This is why you pass `price_change_pct`.
- **credibility** (both, a MULTIPLIER): `notional_vol ≥ $25M` → 1.0, ramping down to 0.45 at the $1M
  floor; unknown vol → 0.8. A thin book is discounted, never allowed to out-shout a deep one.
- **freshness** (social only, a MULTIPLIER; always 1.0 in 2.0, which keeps no history): 1.0 if this asset+detector wasn't surfaced in the last
  ~45 min; drops toward 0.3 the more recently it was, then recovers. The anti-repeat engine.

## Anti-noise (before ranking)
- **Below the $1M `CRED_FLOOR_VOL`** — dropped entirely. The **trade** feed additionally drops anything
  below `TRADE_CRED_FLOOR` ($5M) — a book too thin to act on.
- **Below the feed's floor** — `MIN_SOCIAL` (30, inclusive) / `MIN_TRADE` (45, strict).
- **Per detector family, cap `FAMILY_CAP` (2)** — no more four-funding floods.
- **Per asset**, one signal per *family* (near-duplicate angles like divergence+conviction collapse to
  the strongest); a 2nd, *different*-family angle on the same asset only if it's strong (≥60).
- **A whale that's a holding, not a move** — dropped in `normalize_event` (needs change/open/flip).
- **The obvious** — a plain price move with no OI/funding/smart-money/whale angle is not a signal here.
