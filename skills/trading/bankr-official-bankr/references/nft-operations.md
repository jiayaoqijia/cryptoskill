## Buying

- **ERC-20-priced listings work** — for example USDG listings on Robinhood Chain. Bankr submits the payment-token approval, checks your balance of that currency before signing, and prices the listing in its own decimals, so the quoted amount is what you pay. Collection offers are always paid in an ERC-20 — WETH (Bankr wraps any shortfall from ETH) or the collection's own currency, such as USDG on some Robinhood Chain collections.
- **Floor buys survive being sniped.** "The cheapest X" walks the candidate listings: if the one Bankr picked is bought out mid-purchase (order invalid or not found, marketplace rejection, signer simulation revert), it moves to the next-cheapest, up to **three purchase attempts**. Anything else — a price above your cap, insufficient balance, a wallet-safety block — fails at once. The reply names any substitution, and nothing is retried after a broadcast. Naming a token ID is a single attempt.
- **A specific-NFT buy funds its own shortfall.** If the wallet is short of the listing's currency, the purchase swaps in the difference from stablecoins or native tokens on the same chain first — only in a Bankr wallet whose gas Bankr is sponsoring. Don't send a separate funding swap first. Floor buys don't do this.
- **Recipient allowlists block marketplace actions.** An API key with `allowedRecipients` set can't buy, list, mint, or make or accept offers, since the counterparty can't be allowlisted; NFT transfers are checked against the list.
