"""senpi-signals ranker — dual-lens (trade + social) scoring of one market reading.

ONE sweep → TWO ranked feeds from the same detected signals:
  - trade  : Senpi USERS building ideas — actionable EDGE, price CONFIRMATION, credible enough to
             act on. A static funding extreme scores LOW here (carry, not a directional edge); a
             winning smart-money divergence scores HIGH.
  - social : market-news content — surprising, non-obvious, credibility-gated. Static extremes are
             fine here.

Core principle: rank credible, actionable EDGE.

Input JSON: { "asset_metrics": { "<asset>": {oi, price, price_change_pct, smart_share, smart_dir,
              crowd_dir, funding_pctile, funding_annualized_pct, notional_vol, dex, oi_side} },
              "events": [ pre-formed signals (whale_move / momentum_event / cross_asset_laggard) ] }

2.0 runs WITHOUT --state: one reading, no compare. Nothing is read from or written to history, so the
change detectors (oi_surge, funding_flip, sm_conviction, sm_positioning_build, sm_flow, whale moves)
never fire and back-to-back runs rank the same. --state PATH turns on the history engine for v2
(compare over periods): a RING of snapshots the change detectors diff against ~DIFF_TARGET_MIN old,
plus per-consumer anti-repeat memory. Stdlib only.

Thresholds mirror references/detectors.md — change them in BOTH places.

    statement that price already moved, so confirming it with the same move scores the same
    evidence twice — and it systematically prefers late signals. For "spot it as it emerges",
    flat price is the valuable state: the positioning is in and the move has not happened.

    "price already ran with it" — and rendered as the sentence "price already ran — late", a claim
    about a move nobody measured. Unknown now has its own value, below a confirmed read and above a
    contradicted one, and its own wording in `trade_read`.

    (The old function scored "no direction" at 0.50 — the exact median — so a signal with no side
