# KryptoGO Meme Trader Agent Skill

## Overview

This skill enables an AI agent to **analyze and trade** meme coins through the KryptoGO platform, combining deep on-chain cluster analysis with trade execution.

**Analysis** (multi-chain: Solana, BSC, Base, Monad): wallet clustering, accumulation/distribution detection, address behavior labels, network-wide accumulation signals (Pro/Alpha tier).

**Trading** (Solana only): portfolio monitoring with PnL tracking, swap execution via DEX aggregator, local transaction signing (private key never leaves the machine).

**Default mode is supervised** — all trades require user confirmation. Autonomous trading is available as opt-in. See `references/autonomous-trading.md` for autonomous mode, cron setup, and learning system details.

---

## When to Use

- User asks to analyze a meme coin or token on Solana/BSC/Base/Monad
- User asks to trade, buy, or sell tokens
- User asks to scan for trending tokens or market opportunities
- User asks to monitor portfolio positions or check PnL
- Cron-triggered periodic portfolio monitoring and signal scanning

## When NOT to Use

- BTC/ETH/major L1 macro analysis, NFTs, cross-chain bridging, non-DEX transactions, non-Solana trading

---

## Setup Flow

### 1. Get API Key

1. Go to [kryptogo.xyz/account](https://www.kryptogo.xyz/account) and create an API key
2. Add to `~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`:
   ```bash
   echo 'KRYPTOGO_API_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_KEY' >> ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env
   ```

> **Do NOT paste your API key directly in chat.** Always set secrets via `.env` file.

### 2. Generate Agent Wallet

```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py
```

Creates a Solana keypair, saves to `.env` with chmod 600, prints public address to fund.

### 3. Fund the Wallet

Send SOL to the agent's public address (minimum 0.1 SOL).

### Security Rules

- **NEVER** print, log, or include private keys in any message or CLI argument
- **NEVER** accept secrets pasted directly in chat — instruct users to set them in `.env`
- **NEVER** use the Read tool on `.env` — load credentials via `source` command only
- Runtime scripts do NOT read `.env` directly — all credentials are accessed via environment variables only, which must be pre-loaded by the caller (`source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`)
- **Exception:** `scripts/setup.py` reads and writes `.env` for initial keypair generation and address repair — this is the only script that touches credential files
- Private key stays in memory only during local signing — never sent to any server

---

## Authentication

All endpoints require: `Authorization: Bearer sk_live_<48 hex chars>`

| Tier  | Daily API Calls | Trading Fee | Signal Dashboard | KOL Finder |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Free  | 100 calls/day   | 1%          | No               | No         |
| Pro   | 1,000 calls/day | 0.5%        | Yes              | Yes        |
| Alpha | 5,000 calls/day | 0%          | Yes              | Yes        |

---

## Agent Behavior

### Session Initialization

On every session start (including heartbeat/cron), the agent MUST load credentials BEFORE running any scripts:

```bash
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env
```

This is REQUIRED — scripts do not read `.env` directly. All credentials are accessed via environment variables only.

### Default Mode: Supervised

By default, the agent operates in **supervised mode**: it analyzes tokens, presents recommendations, and waits for user approval before executing any trade. Stop-loss/take-profit conditions are reported to the user but not auto-executed.

To enable autonomous trading, set `require_trade_confirmation: false` in preferences. See `references/autonomous-trading.md` for full details.

### Persistence (CRITICAL)

**IMMEDIATELY after submitting a transaction, the agent MUST:**
1. Write trade details to `memory/trading-journal.json` with `status: "OPEN"`
2. Include: `token_symbol`, `token_address`, `entry_price`, `position_size_sol`, `tx_hash`, `timestamp`

### User Preferences

Store in `memory/trading-preferences.json`:

| Preference | Default | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `max_position_size` | 0.1 SOL | Max SOL per trade |
| `max_open_positions` | 5 | Max concurrent open positions |
| `max_daily_trades` | 20 | Max trades per day |
| `stop_loss_pct` | 30% | Notify/sell when loss exceeds this |
| `take_profit_pct` | 100% | Notify/sell when gain exceeds this |
| `min_market_cap` | $500K | Skip tokens below this |
| `scan_count` | 10 | Trending tokens per scan |
| `risk_tolerance` | "conservative" | "conservative" (skip medium risk), "moderate" (ask on medium), "aggressive" (auto-trade medium) |
| `require_trade_confirmation` | true | Set to false for autonomous mode |
| `chains` | ["solana"] | Chains to scan |

---

## Safety Guardrails

### Trading Limits (Hard Caps)

| Limit | Default | Overridable? |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| Max single trade | 0.1 SOL | Yes, via `max_position_size` |
| Max concurrent positions | 5 | Yes, via `max_open_positions` |
| Max daily trade count | 20 | Yes, via `max_daily_trades` |
| Price impact abort | >10% | No — always abort |
| Price impact warn | >5% | No — always warn |

If any limit is hit, the agent **must stop and notify the user**.

### Credential Isolation

Runtime scripts in this skill do NOT read `.env` files directly. All credentials are accessed via environment variables only, which must be pre-loaded by the caller (`source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env`). This ensures no runtime script can independently access or exfiltrate credential files.

**Exception:** `scripts/setup.py` reads and writes `.env` — it loads existing keys to avoid regeneration, backs up `.env` before changes, and writes new keypair entries. This is the only script that touches credential files, and it runs only during initial setup or explicit `--force` regeneration.

---

## Automated Monitoring (Cron)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Supervised mode (default): analysis + notifications, no auto-execution
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && bash scripts/cron-examples.sh setup-default

# Autonomous mode (opt-in): auto-buys and auto-sells
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && bash scripts/cron-examples.sh setup-autonomous

# Remove all cron jobs
bash scripts/cron-examples.sh teardown
```

| Job | Interval | Default Behavior |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `stop-loss-tp` | 5 min | Report triggered conditions, do NOT auto-sell |
| `discovery-scan` | 1 hour | Analyze and send recommendations, do NOT auto-buy |

For full cron configuration, manual setup, heartbeat alternative, and monitoring workflow details, see `references/autonomous-trading.md`.

## On-Chain Analysis Framework (7-Step Pipeline)

### Step 1: Token Overview & Market Cap Filter

`/token-overview?address=<mint>&chain_id=<id>` — get name, price, market cap, holders, risk_level. Skip if market cap < `min_market_cap`.

### Step 2: Cluster Analysis

`/analyze/<mint>?chain_id=<id>` — wallet clusters, top holders, metadata.
- ≥30-35% = "controlled" — major entity present
- ≥50% = high concentration risk
- Single cluster >50% → skip (rug pull risk)

> **Free tier limitation:** Cluster analysis only returns the top 2 clusters. To see full cluster data, upgrade at [kryptogo.xyz/pricing](https://www.kryptogo.xyz/pricing).

### Step 3: Cluster Trend (Multi-Timeframe)

`/analyze-cluster-change/<mint>` — `cluster_ratio` + `changes` across 15m/1h/4h/1d/7d.

Core insight: **Price and cluster holdings DIVERGING** is the key signal.
- Rising price + falling cluster % = distribution (bearish)
- Falling price + rising cluster % = accumulation (bullish)

### Step 4: Address Labels + Sell Pressure Verification

1. `/token-wallet-labels` → identify dev/sniper/bundle wallets
2. `/balance-history` for each risky address → check if still holding
3. Compute `risky_ratio` = active risky holdings / total cluster holdings
4. >30% = high risk, 10-30% = medium, <10% = low

> Labels represent *behavioral history*, not current holdings. Always verify via `/balance-history`.

### Step 5: Deep Dive (Optional)

`/balance-history`, `/balance-increase/<mint>`, `/top-holders-snapshot/<mint>`, `/analyze-dca-limit-orders/<mint>`, `/cluster-wallet-connections`

### Step 6: Decision

Apply Bullish Checklist from `references/decision-framework.md`.

### Step 7: Execute Trade

**Use `scripts/swap.py` for execution** — handles wallet_address injection, error checking, and journal logging.

```bash
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && python3 scripts/swap.py <token_mint> 0.1
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && python3 scripts/swap.py <token_mint> <amount> --sell
```

---

## Operational Scripts

All scripts require credentials to be pre-loaded: `source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env` before running.

```bash
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && bash scripts/portfolio.sh              # Portfolio check
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && bash scripts/trending.sh               # Trending tokens
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && bash scripts/analysis.sh               # Full analysis dashboard
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && python3 scripts/swap.py <mint> 0.1     # Buy
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && python3 scripts/swap.py <mint> <amt> --sell  # Sell
source ~/.openclaw/workspace/.env && bash scripts/test-api.sh               # API connectivity test
```

---

## Learning & Adaptation

The agent improves over time by recording trades, analyzing outcomes, and adjusting strategy. Every trade is logged to `memory/trading-journal.json`, losses trigger post-mortems, and periodic reviews propose parameter changes.

For full details on the learning system, trade journal format, post-mortem process, and strategy reviews, see `references/autonomous-trading.md`.

---

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Key Insight |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cluster** | Group of wallets controlled by same entity |
| **Cluster Ratio** | % of supply held by clusters. ≥30% = controlled, ≥50% = high risk |
| **Developer** | Deployed the token. Highest dump risk |
| **Sniper** | Bought within 1s of creation. Sell pressure if not cleared |
| **Smart Money** | Realized profit >$100K. Accumulation often precedes price moves |
| **Accumulation** | Cluster % rising + price consolidating = bullish |
| **Distribution** | Price rising + cluster % falling = bearish |

> Full concepts guide: see `references/concepts.md`

## Best Practices

1. Always check `/agent/account` first to confirm tier and quota
2. Always check `/agent/portfolio` on startup to detect existing positions
3. Never expose private keys in logs, messages, or CLI arguments
4. Validate price impact before submitting — abort >10%, warn >5%
5. Sign and submit promptly — blockhash expires after ~60 seconds
6. Persist state to `memory/trading-state.json` after every action
7. Log every trade to journal — no exceptions
8. Read `memory/trading-lessons.md` before scanning — avoid repeating known bad patterns
