# Lifecycle internals — what `deploy.py` and `close.py` actually do

Both scripts live in `senpi-strategy-ops/scripts/`, share `_pkg.py` (package model) + `_cli.py`
(openclaw CLI + tolerant JSON digging) + `mcp_client.py` (vendored stdlib HTTP MCP client, reads
`SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` / `SENPI_MCP_URL`). They are **stdlib-only**: PyYAML is used if it happens to be
installed, else a vendored stdlib YAML loader, so no pip step is ever required. No daemons, no
`push_signal`.

## Why there is no scanner daemon anymore

Runtime 2.x **supervises** the scanner. Installing a runtime (the deploy verb's install step) hot-loads
it: the runtime spawns the Python scaffold child and calls `scan(inputs, ctx)` every `interval_seconds`,
time-boxed by `timeout_seconds`, restarting a crashed child itself. The old model (a separate
`nohup python3 … &` producer daemon that pushed signals over HTTP) is gone. Deploy = create a runtime;
nothing else to keep alive.

## Deploy — the runtime's `openclaw senpi deploy` verb

Deploy is **one verb running as a detached job**, not a blocking call and not a chain of scripted steps:
wallet funding (CREATE → FUND → ACTIVE, incl. bridging) and the first scan tick (up to an instance's
`interval_seconds`) are each multi-minute waits that would blow the ~180s tool/session timeout. The verb
returns in ~1s with a `deployId`; the agent polls `openclaw senpi deploy status` until the job is terminal.

**Before any of this, the package must have been proven runnable** — `openclaw senpi validate
<recipe-dir>` returning `PASS`. That answers a different question ("does the scanner actually run
and read?") from the one below ("did the deploy land?"), and it is **not optional**: a passing,
unscoped live-depth run writes the `.senpi-proof.json` beside that instance's recipe, and the deploy
verb refuses pre-money without one (`[E_VALIDATE_NO_PROOF]` / `[E_VALIDATE_CONTENT_CHANGED]` /
`[E_VALIDATE_RUNTIME_VERSION_CHANGED]`, distinguished by the `reason` on the refused step's
`evidence`).

That run loads every scanner file, calls one real tick against live read-only data, counts what it
read, and checks each emitted signal against the runtime's own wire schema — no wallet, no funding.
The proof it writes names **the exact file bytes it passed over and the runtime version it passed
under**, which is what makes `CONTENT_CHANGED` and `RUNTIME_VERSION_CHANGED` separable afterwards.
**Only a full, unscoped run at live depth records one**: `--scanner <name>`, `--no-attest` and
`--stage static|import` deliberately record nothing, and `deploy.py validate` records nothing either
(it is the structural pass, not the run). So the flow is **validate → deploy, per instance**, and a
package whose files were edited needs a fresh `validate` before the next `create`. **One run per
instance, each pointed at the dir holding its `runtime.yaml`** — the package root for a flat package
(no `instances:` list), the instance's own dir once `strategy.yaml` lists them, which every catalog
package does; a root that lists instances and holds no recipe of its own refuses
`[E_VALIDATE_NO_RECIPE]` and lists the instances to pick from. **`UNPROVEN` (exit 2) is not a pass**
— the tick ran and established nothing, usually a gate in `scan()` that should consult
`ctx.dry_run`.

**`deploy.py` repairs exactly one of those three, once.** A proof recorded under a different runtime
build (`runtime_version_changed`) says the package is untouched and only the engine under it moved —
and the runtime self-updates in place on the fleet, so every update invalidates every proof on the
box. `run_deploy` re-runs `openclaw senpi validate` for the directories the refusal names and
re-invokes the deploy **once** for that reason only, keyed on the structured `evidence.reason`
rather than the refusal text. `no_proof` and `content_changed` are relayed untouched — both mean
someone changed something — and a re-validation that does not `PASS` prints validate's own findings
and does not re-run the deploy.

Before any of them, **package-level gates run once, pre-money** — recorded at the reconcile step, so a
refusal there means nothing was created **by that run**: no exit block on an instance (a strategy that
cannot stop itself out is never funded), an unsupported scanner-level `enabled` key (`[INVALID_REQUEST]`), and the
**live-universe gate** — every hardcoded instrument checked against the live HL instrument list,
refusing **`[E_UNIVERSE_NOT_LIVE]`** on any dead name (one refusal, every offender, each with its file
and key path; a bare `T` counts as live if `xyz:T` is) and **failing closed with no code** when that list
cannot be read, because unknown is never "not live". A package with no hardcoded instruments (a derived
universe) never reads the list at all.

**Relay each refusal as scoped as its own producer writes it — do not normalise them to one sentence.**
The universe gate and the proof gate above both say "nothing was created **by this run** … and whatever
this package already had is untouched (this gate cannot see it)", because they stop before reading the
package's live state: on a resume there may be a funded, live wallet the refusal cannot see, and the
unscoped version is what funds a second one beside it. The exit-block and `enabled` refusals state it
flat — that is their producers' wording, not a discrepancy to correct. (Scoping is not a property of
"pre-money": `[E_INSTANCE_BINDING_UNKNOWN]` is flat *and* correct, because it has already read the live
wallets and lists them.)

Per instance the job runs five steps, each recorded with its own outcome:

1. **reconcile** — read live backend strategies and match by `strategyName` (`<id>` for a single-instance
   package, `<id>-<instance>` for a multi, sanitized), **compared case-insensitively** because the backend
   case-normalizes what it stores ("WARPATH" in, "warpath" back) while the sanitizer deliberately keeps
   capitals. An empty name on either side is never a match — two absences are not an identity.
   **The name-matched set is then partitioned by the `skillName` stamp**, because a name is not an
   identity: `<id>-<instance>` and a flat package whose id IS `<id>-<instance>` derive the same name, so
   two different packages can answer to one. A candidate is **ours** when its stamp is this package's
   (case-folded, same reason as the name) **or absent**; it is **foreign** only when a stamp is present and
   names someone else. Absent stays bindable on purpose — an MCP that stops returning `strategyMetadata`
   would otherwise stop every package recognising its own wallet and fund a second one beside it on each
   re-run. Wallets predating attribution, and wallets created by hand through the MCP, are stampless for
   the same reason. When every name-match is foreign → refuse **`[E_WALLET_OWNED_BY_OTHER_PACKAGE]`**
   (pre-money, nothing created): adopting one would install this package's runtime onto another package's
   funded wallet and its open positions. A name shared by one of ours and one of theirs is not an
   ambiguity — the stamp says which is which — so the foreign one is neither bound nor refused over.
   Among the candidates that ARE ours: exactly one live match → **adopt** its wallet
   (create is skipped). More than one → refuse **`[E_STATE_AMBIGUOUS_WALLETS]`**: one may be a funded live
   strategy, so it points at read-only triage and never at close/recreate. Zero → this instance needs a wallet
   — **unless live wallets carry this package's `skillName` stamp and nothing in this run accounted for
   them**, which refuses **`[E_INSTANCE_BINDING_UNKNOWN]`** instead. **Deploy refuses rather than funding a
   second wallet when it cannot account for a package's live wallets**: "I could not tell which of these is
   this instance" is never "there are none", and creating there funds a new wallet beside a live one and
   rebinds the instance's runtime id onto it. The gate is decided once the WHOLE package has been matched,
   so a wallet a sibling sleeve just adopted is accounted for and a partial multi-sleeve deploy still
   proceeds; it cannot fire on a first deploy, where nothing carries the stamp yet.
   **That refusal is a refusal to RE-READ, never a reason to re-run with a bigger budget** — nothing about
   it is a funding shortfall, and a re-run binds by the same two routes (the derived name, and a create key
   journaled on this box) that just failed, so it changes nothing until the user says what those wallets
   are. The steer is `status.py <id>` first; `close.py <id>` is named last and only on the user's
   confirmation, because it tears down the whole package.
   The gate survives a starved NAME route (an older MCP build, a backend that renames) but not a starved
   STAMP: an MCP that stops returning `strategyMetadata` empties its candidate filter, which is why the
   verb logs a stampless non-empty strategy list rather than passing over it in silence.

   **The NAME and the `skillName` STAMP are both compared CASE-FOLDED** — `.strip().lower()` on both
   sides, in both layers (`_cli.strategy_name_match` / `strategy_skill_match` here; `.trim().toLowerCase()`
   in `src/deploy/orchestrator.ts`). The verb stamps `pkg.id` **verbatim** at create while the backend
   case-normalizes what it stores, so an exact compare asks a different question than the layer that wrote
   the field: for a package id `Warpath` the runtime's own gates matched and `close.py Warpath` matched
   **nothing**, printing "no OPEN strategies to close." over a live, funded, trading wallet. Folding widens
   nothing across packages — two different ids stay different, so `spider` and `spider-swing` are as
   distinguishable folded as unfolded; what rules a candidate out is the stamp's VALUE. `strategy.yaml`
   now refuses a mixed-case `id` at validate (pre-money, in both the ops and the author validator), so
   there is one canonical stamp going forward and the fold is what covers wallets already stamped under
   one.

   **One compare is still exact, and it is a known gap, not a doctrine:** `deploy.py`'s `verify_instance`
   rules a name-matched candidate foreign on `strategy_skill_declared(s) not in (None, pkg.id)`. A package
   already deployed under a mixed-case id therefore gets a **false** foreign-owner collision row from
   `verify` — read-only, already-hedged text (it quotes the stamp and never claims who created the
   wallet), on the do-not-deploy path. `status.py` and `close.py` read through the folded matcher and are
   unaffected.
2. **preflight** — `account_get_portfolio` (forced fresh) → the accessible-USDC waterfall (HL perps + HL
   spot USDC + EVM USDC; never `total_withdrawable`) → the funding plan (split by `funding_share`, floored
   at **$10/wallet** — the platform floor `min_budget.py` owns — minus a per-wallet fee buffer). A shortfall
   **HALTS** with `[E_FUNDS_SHORT]` or `[E_FUNDS_BELOW_FLOOR]` and **no create call is made**. The budget is
   a hard target — it is never silently scaled down. An unreadable balance yields "unknown" and the deploy
   proceeds: the backend is the funding authority and would fail loudly.
   Once that hard floor passes, the step computes the package's **calculated minimum** locally (the verb's
   port of `min_budget.py`, parity-tested against it) and **warns, never refuses**, when a wallet comes up
   short: `[W_BUDGET_BELOW_STRATEGY_MIN]`, or `[W_BUDGET_UNRESOLVED]` when a sleeve's sizing could not be
   read and the figure is only a lower bound (that note carries the shortfall too, and the same escape).
   The floor is the platform's rule; the calculated minimum is a design estimate and the user sizes their
   own budget. Both land on the final report (`minBudget`, `minWalletCount`, `belowMin`, `minBudgetNote`,
   `minBudgetUnresolved`) so they survive to a `live` render, not just the running narration; `belowMin`
   is set under either code.
   **The shortfall claim is PER WALLET, against what each one is actually allocated** — not the whole
   budget against the whole-package minimum. Those two differ the moment anything is adopted:
   `planFunding` splits the budget among the instances still NEEDING a wallet, while `minBudget` is
   computed across every instance. Comparing the totals once announced a shortfall on a re-run that was
   handing a single $13.50 sleeve the entire $20 — money that was not short, on a deploy that was not
   even touching the other sleeve. `minBudget`/`minWalletCount` therefore ride the report as
   **context** ("deploying the whole package fresh needs $30 across 2 wallets"), never as the claim.
   The escape is **close-then-redeploy** — a re-run at a larger `--budget` would only adopt what is
   already there — and it is **scoped to the underfunded sleeves** (`close.py <id> --instance <name>`),
   because `close.py <id>` would tear down adopted, live, funded sleeves this warn is not about.
   **No emitted command may need a precondition the report lacks**, so the scoped form appears only
   when those sleeves have a live RUNTIME: `--instance` resolves a sleeve through its runtime and
   hard-exits without one, and its error text then tells the reader to omit `--instance` and close
   the whole package — the exact widening the scoping exists to prevent. The other states get what
   they can actually support: a funded wallet with no runtime (deadline-abandoned after create, or a
   failed rollback) gets a read-only `status.py <id>` triage pointer and NO teardown command; a
   deploy that created nothing gets no escape at all; and where `[E_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE]` is present
   it owns the cleanup, so the budget warn defers to it by name instead of emitting a second,
   differently-scoped close. The redeploy figure is sized for every wallet the re-run will fund —
   the closed sleeves plus any that never got a wallet — not just the ones being closed.
   An instance that declares **no `funding_share`** is sized against `1/n` — the split a FRESH deploy of
   the package would apply — rather than `min_budget.py`'s whole-book `1.0`, which understates the total
   by the wallet count. (The Python is safe with `1.0` because it only runs at catalog-generation time, on
   packages `_pkg.validate` has already forced to declare shares summing to 1; the verb is a direct path
   with no such gate.) A **quoted** share (`"0.4"`) parses as a number here, matching `min_budget._f` so
   the card's `min_budget` and the verb's agree — note this does NOT make the whole card agree: `_pkg.py`
   reads the field raw (a quoted share raises in `_pkg.validate`) and `gen_catalog.derive_funding_split`
   drops non-numeric values, so a quoted share is a packaging bug `deploy.py validate` catches loudly.
3. **create** — one `strategy_create_custom_strategy(initialBudget, positions=[], strategyName,
   skillName=<id>, skillVersion=<version>)` per needing instance, then poll `strategy_list` to **ACTIVE**
   (bounded by `--max-wait`, default 150s — `deploy.py` forwards the same flag and defaults it identically;
   an explicit value also becomes `deploy.py`'s own poll budget, in either direction). **One wallet at a
   time**: each instance is polled to ACTIVE before the next is submitted, all under that one shared
   budget. `strategy_create_custom_strategy` returns at `CREATE_WALLET` and funds asynchronously, so
   concurrent legs would draw on the same embedded wallet — the loser reads a balance the winner already
   claimed, funds $0 and parks in `PENDING_FUNDING`. **Every wallet is named for its role in the
   strategy** — a WhaleHunter deploy with two sub-wallets creates `whalehunter-long` and
   `whalehunter-short`, never a bare `0x…` address, so the user can tell a strategy's wallets apart in
   the app, in balances and in notifications. A name rejection retries **once** without `strategyName` —
   naming is best-effort legibility and must never block a deploy. Deadline hit → `pending` (re-run resumes).
   That ACTIVE read's `totalFunded` is also the **outcome** check on the budget: the final report compares
   it against what `planFunding` asked for and warns `[W_BUDGET_PARTIAL_FUND]` below 90%, naming each
   wallet once (`main (0x…) funded $60.00 of requested $500.00 (12%, short $440.00)`). The successor to the old three-step
   verify gate's deleted `_budget_verdict` — but a `W_`, not its not-live verdict: the wallet is funded and the runtime
   ticks, so `overall` and the exit code do not move, and closing a live strategy over a shortfall a
   top-up fixes is the teardown this repo keeps having to prevent. The figures are **as at deploy
   time** and the note re-renders on every later `deploy status`, so the route is: re-read the current
   funding (`status.py <id>`) FIRST, then add the remaining difference through the
   `senpi-deposit-withdraw-transfer` skill. Close-and-redeploy is named as the alternative with no
   command attached, because `[E_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE]` and the below-min escape are the report's only
   close-command producers — and where that rollback line is present this warn is silent for that
   wallet entirely, so one report never carries two opposite money moves on one address. The
   "nothing is broken, the strategy is LIVE" line only appears when the report supports it.
   It stays silent where there is nothing to compare: a wallet nobody planned to fund (an adopted one
   whose ask a PRIOR run of the package journaled IS compared, though — against a fresh read, so a
   crash between a partial fund and the report does not resume as a clean `live`), a create that never
   reached ACTIVE (no funded figure was read), a rolled-back wallet. Exactly 90% does not fire.
   When the backend reports no readable `totalFunded` at all, the wallet gets
   `[W_BUDGET_FUNDED_UNREADABLE]` instead — the ask, no percentage, no shortfall, no top-up, and the
   user asked to verify what actually landed. An unread amount is never reported as `$0.00`.
4. **install** — render the instance's `runtime.yaml` (substitute `${wallet_env}` + the decision-model env
   iff a `decision_mode: llm` action) and install it with the instance directory attached, so `path:
   ./scanners` resolves against the YAML's own directory. An existing runtime already on this wallet is an
   idempotent skip; one bound to a **different/old** wallet is **deleted and recreated** on the fresh wallet,
   never updated in place.
5. **observe** — poll the runtime's scanner rows for one **fresh** tick within `--tick-wait` (default 120s).
   What counts as a tick depends on the scanner: an interval (built-in) scanner proves it ran with
   `lastRunStatus` of `ok` **or `heartbeat`** — `ok` literally means "found a signal", so a quiet scanner
   records `heartbeat` and that is still a tick; an **external** (supervised push) scanner proves it with a
   fresh `lastAliveAt`, because intake short-circuits an empty POST before any run telemetry and a
   watch-only scanner therefore never records a run status at all. **Fresh** means at or after this
   install: scanner telemetry is name-keyed and survives a re-mint, so a stale `ok` from a previous
   incarnation never certifies this one. Seen → `ok` with the row quoted verbatim. Not seen →
   **`unobserved`**, which is truthful, not success — and when the registry says the first tick is still
   ahead of the window, the report names *when* it is due. A row that **errored since this install** →
   `failed` immediately, quoting `lastError` (polling the rest of the budget adds nothing). Every scanner
   disabled → `unobserved` with that said out loud, not a silent wait. `--tick-wait 0` skips the check
   entirely and reports `installed-unobserved`; it **can never report `live`**.

   A package whose scanner entries carry an **`enabled` key** is refused up front, before anything is
   created — whatever the value. The engine never reads a scanner-level `enabled` (registration comes
   from the strategy, not the scanner entry), so an `enabled: false` scanner would register and tick
   anyway: the package would trade while its author believes it is switched off. The refusal names
   every offending line — instance, scanner, file, value — so one edit pass fixes the package. A
   scanner runs because the package declares it: to stop one, remove the scanner entry.

**No local deploy state.** There is no `.deploy-state.json` any more — the backend strategies and the
runtime registry ARE the record, which is what killed the whole `E_STATE_*` lost-state class. The job does
keep an append-only JSONL journal under the runtime's state dir (`deploys/<deployId>.jsonl`), but it is
**narration only**: nothing ever reads it to decide an action. It is read for exactly three things —
rendering `deploy status` history, the boot scan that stamps a journal left unterminated by a restart as
`interrupted`, and one narrow carve-out: the **strategyId this box journaled at create time**, used only
as a LOOKUP KEY when reconcile's name match finds nothing (a create whose custom name the backend rejected
lands under a backend-assigned name that the name match can never find again). Every such id is re-read
from the live backend before reconcile may act on it — the journal supplies the key, the backend supplies
the decision. Nothing auto-resumes; only a fresh deploy does, and it reconciles.

**Single-flight, and self-freeing.** One deploy job per agent. A second start refuses
`[E_DEPLOY_IN_PROGRESS]`: concurrent deploys read one shared funding waterfall and two preflights could
both pass while jointly overdrawing. **There is no cancel** — undeploying is closing the strategy
(`close.py`), not stopping the job. Instead every MCP call the job makes is deadline-bounded — the job stops
*waiting* on an overrunning call, which is what makes the step boundary reachable; the request may
still be in flight server-side, so an overrun is reported as an unknown outcome, never as a failure —
and the job carries a wall-clock deadline: past it the run is abandoned at its **next step boundary** (an in-flight
money-moving call always completes and is journaled) and, after a grace longer than any single call's
deadline (so the abandoned job is no longer *waiting* on a money-moving call when the slot comes back —
a call it stopped waiting on may still land server-side, which the next deploy reconciles), the slot is
freed even if the run is still wedged inside an await. An abandoned deploy reports `failed` with the
resume command.

**Rollback is exactly one case.** A wallet **this job created and funded** whose *install* then failed is
closed and its funds returned (`strategy_close` returns them to the owner wallet on its own). Never an
adopted wallet — it predates this deploy; never on an observe failure — the runtime is installed and may
open a position at any moment; never on a refusal — nothing was created. If that close cannot run (the
wallet holds open positions) or fails, the report says **`[E_ROLLBACK_INCOMPLETE]`** and names the wallet,
the amount and the command to reclaim it: a stranded funded wallet is never silent. That command is an MCP
**`strategy_close` on that wallet address** — a funded wallet with no runtime cannot be reached by
`close.py --instance`. The package-wide `close.py <id>` is offered **only** when nothing else in the
package is live; otherwise the caveat names the live sleeves it would take down and says not to reach for
it. Run the command the report prints, never a wider one. The crash case does not
unwind — the boot scan never moves money — so an `interrupted` status names both exits (re-run to adopt,
or close to reclaim) along with the amount, read fresh from the backend.

## `deploy.py {validate|create|runtime} <id> | verify <id> | status [<id>] …` — the funded path

`deploy.py` keeps its CLI contract but no longer deploys anything itself. It owns the **front half** —
package resolution (a path, or a bare catalog id fetched from the remote — `validate` resolves the
same way, so it moves no money and installs nothing but does write a fetched package to disk) and the
structural
preflight (`validate` also makes one read-only `market_list_instruments` call to report the universe,
so it needs `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` and can take a few seconds — up to ~25s on a slow or token-less host,
which ends in the loud note, never in a failed validate) — then starts the verb, polls `deploy
status`, and relays the report **verbatim**.
It polls for **~150s** by default and then returns, which keeps the call inside the ~180s tool/session
timeout the detached job exists to escape; a longer foreground wait would simply get the call killed,
losing the report and the exit code while the job runs on. A job still running at the lapse is
reported as **pending
(exit 6)** with the snapshot and the `openclaw senpi deploy status` command to watch it — the honest
outcome, not a failure. An explicit `--max-wait` replaces that budget in either direction. Its two
money-moving subcommands (`create` / `runtime`) drive the same idempotent verb — one path under two
names, either of which resumes and adopts what exists. **`--dry-run` and `--json` are mutually
exclusive** (refused, exit `1`, nothing planned): the plan is prose only — a JSON report needs a real
run.

The structural preflight **accepts the flat single-instance layout** agents naturally scaffold — one
`runtime.yaml` + `scanners/` at the package root — by synthesizing the canonical `main` instance, so
there is **no need to restructure into `main/`**. Any remaining fix is named prescriptively (e.g.
`set runtime name: <id>-main`), and every structural + render issue is reported in **one pass**.

**`verify` drives nothing.** It is the READ-ONLY check: per instance it composes MCP `strategy_list`
(a live, non-dead strategy under the name the verb assigns — `<id>`, or `<id>-<instance>` on a
multi-instance package — with its status and `totalFunded`), `openclaw senpi runtime list` (is a
runtime registered on this instance's wallet?) and `openclaw senpi status --json` (the runtime's own
health verdict, quoted verbatim), then relays the last deploy job's `[W_*]` warn lines **iff that job
ran this package** (no snapshot is not a failure — a package deployed before the verb has none). It
**quotes**; it never re-derives a status or a number. It
**honours** no deploy flag — there is no job to size, wait for or plan, and **no `--budget` handed to
it funds anything**, because a check that can fund a wallet is not a check — but it still **accepts** the
five it used to carry (`--budget`, `--max-wait`, `--tick-wait`, `--decision-model`, `--dry-run`) and
ignores each with a stderr warning naming it and pointing at `verify --help`, `SKILL.md` and this
file; the verdict, the reads and the exit code are the flagless ones. Rejecting them was argparse's
exit **2** — the code D-12 teaches as *refused, nothing created, a retry refuses identically* — so a
stale-transcript re-check (`verify spider --max-wait 300`) read as "the deploy was refused" over a
package that may be perfectly live. A flag it never had (a typo like `--bugdet`) still errors. Its
exit codes are its own — **`0`** verified (an **ACTIVE** wallet + registered runtime + healthy, per
instance) ·
**`3`** not verified (each instance names what is missing/unhealthy plus the one non-destructive next
step: `deploy.py create <id> --budget <usd>` where nothing is funded, `deploy.py runtime <id>` on a
funded runtime-less wallet — each named **with the fact that it installs and starts trading** — and
`status.py <id>` for degraded/unknown/ambiguous states) · **`1`** could-not-check, fail-closed: if
`strategy_list`, `runtime list`, `status --json`, **the deploy-job read** or **the package itself**
cannot be read, NO verdict is rendered at all, the failed read is named, and nothing steers at the
money path. It never emits a close command. All three verdicts print the SAME `--json` keys on clean
stdout —
`deploy_job_running` is `null` on a could-not-check that never got as far as reading the job, and
`next` carries that verdict's own step (`null` on a rendered verdict, where the steps are the
per-instance ones). `next` is what a `--json` caller reads on the two could-not-check subclasses
where the taught "re-read" cannot work — a package that does not parse, a package that is not here:
both say retrying answers nothing and what to fix instead.

Four rules keep `verify` from steering at a state it did not read:

- **It resolves the package LOCALLY.** A bare catalog id that isn't on disk is `could-not-check` (1)
  naming the absence — a check that promises "nothing was changed" must not download and write a
  package under the durable strategies root. `create`/`runtime` are what fetch. A package that IS on
  disk but cannot be modelled (bad YAML, no `id`, no instances) is could-not-check too, naming the
  strategy.yaml and the parse failure — never a raw traceback, and `--json` still prints the
  document.
- **Only `ACTIVE` is resumable.** A `PAUSED`/`CLOSING_POSITIONS` wallet (exactly the window the
  doctrine teardown opens: positions closing, runtime already removed — and the verb ADOPTS
  `CLOSING_POSITIONS`, only `CLOSING_DONE` is dead) or a deploy still mid-flight
  (`CREATE_WALLET`/`FUND_WALLET`/`INITIALIZE_POSITIONS`) gets `status.py <id>` triage, never the resume
  verb — and is never verified, even with a healthy runtime still registered against it.
- **A deploy job RUNNING for this package replaces every money steer** with `openclaw senpi deploy
  status`, and the report says the picture is mid-flight. The resume already is that job; re-checking
  during your own `create` must not dispatch a second one. That bit is read fail-closed, and the read
  lands in exactly one of three classes. A **job snapshot** (the shape the verb emits — a
  `state.status`): its `meta.packageId` decides whether it is this package's. A **positive no-job
  answer**: the verb's own `[NOT_FOUND]` (no deploy has ever run here), or a CLI that **rejected the
  command line** — a plugin predating the verb never reached a gateway, so it cannot be running a
  verb job, and a box mid-rollout (fleet skew: skills update hourly, the runtime self-updates on its
  own cadence) gets a verdict instead of a permanent could-not-check. That rejection is matched on
  Commander's parse-error grammar, taken from what the runtime's own CLI prints: since `senpi` grew
  its root `--cheatsheet` action (2026-03-27) it answers `senpi deploy status --json` with
  `error: unknown option '--json'`, **not** "unknown command" — a detector looking for the latter
  matched nothing in the fleet. Both streams are read for that answer: a stray JSON log line on
  stdout must not bury a `[NOT_FOUND]` on stderr. **Whose** parser spoke is part of the answer too:
  the verb shells every gateway round-trip out to an inner `openclaw gateway call … --params …` with
  stderr **inherited**, so an openclaw older than the plugin rejects a flag the plugin passed and
  prints the identical grammar on the identical stream — while the verb exists and a job may be
  funding a wallet. So only a parse error naming a token this script itself sent counts, and any
  answer mentioning the `gateway call` round-trip is transport breakage (a box without the verb
  never gets that far). **Anything else** — spawn failure, timeout, an
  `{"ok": false, …}` envelope or any other JSON that is not a snapshot, and a RUNNING job whose
  snapshot names no package — is could-not-check (1), never "no job". The `[NOT_FOUND]` match is
  anchored to the code at the start of its line, where the verb's refusal puts it: a failed read that
  merely quotes `[NOT_FOUND]` somewhere in its log tail is not an answer about this agent's job.
- **Attribution DISAMBIGUATES the match; it never shrinks it to nothing.** Instances are matched by
  the name the verb derives, across every live strategy. A candidate is dropped only when the record
  carries a WRITTEN `strategyMetadata.skillName` naming a **different** package; a record with no
  attribution at all stays a candidate (a wallet with no attribution is usually the user's own) — and an **empty** stamp (`skillName: ""`, at either the
  metadata or the top level) is no attribution, not a package called `''`. The read parses a
  `strategyMetadata` that arrives JSON-**string**-shaped too: the MCP passes the backend's scalar
  through verbatim, and a payload skipped for its shape would make a foreign wallet read as
  unattributed and be adopted (gating on attribution reported live funded wallets as
  "nothing is funded here" — its `strategy_skill` fallback is `tradingStrategyName`, which on a
  multi-instance package can never equal the package id). When every name-match is another package's
  — single-instance package `spider-swing` is live and `spider`'s `swing` sleeve derives the same
  name — the instance is **NOT VERIFIED (3)** with the collision named (the wanted name and the
  `skillName` stamp on the record): neither the other wallet's runtime/health rendered as this
  sleeve's, nor a `create --budget` on a taken name. What that steer would actually hit is a **refusal**:
  the verb's name route partitions its matches by stamp, and every match here carries a written stamp
  naming another package, so deploy refuses **`[E_WALLET_OWNED_BY_OTHER_PACKAGE]`** pre-money instead of
  adopting. It is still the wrong thing to emit — a refusal is not a next step, and the row is the layer
  that can say what the collision IS. (A name-match with **no** stamp is not foreign to either layer: it
  stays a candidate here and is adopted there.) The row quotes
  that stamp and stops there — it never claims the other package CREATED the wallet, because a
  `skillName` is whatever the creating call wrote (raw-MCP creates stamp anything; script guards are
  advisory), so the user's own wallet stamped with an older or differently-cased id renders here too.
  Triage is read-only and asks by the **stamp** — one `status.py <stamp>` per stamp named (never a
  joined list: `status.py` takes a single id and a joined line exits 2 on the read the reader was
  just told to make), plus bare `status.py` for every open strategy on the agent; `status.py <id>`
  filters on that same field, so it is the one read guaranteed not to show the colliding wallet. Two
  outcomes, both named: if a stamp is a package you have, **that** package is where the wallet is
  checked and operated (`deploy.py verify <stamp>`, read-only). And there is **no re-stamping
  route** — no tool on this path rewrites `strategyMetadata.skillName` (`strategy_update` carries
  slippage, mirror multiplier and SL/TP only) — so if the wallet turns out to be the user's own
  under a stamp nothing owns, the honest answer is that this package cannot adopt it under that name
  and it keeps running as it is. The derived name comes from the verb's own sanitizer
  (`sanitizeStrategyName` in the runtime's `src/deploy/package.ts`): whitespace→`-`,
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` only, trim leading/trailing **`-` only**, 40 chars.

An **unreadable** surface is never an empty one: `strategy_list` answering with a payload that carries
no strategies list at all is `could-not-check` (1), not "nothing is funded here". The converse holds
too — an unreadable surface is not the same as a BROKEN one: a `status --json` entry with no health
field whose run state reads `failed`/`degraded` is **not verified (3)** with that state quoted as a
run state, because positive broken evidence is believed wherever it is found. Only an entry carrying
neither health nor any classifiable evidence (a bare `status: "running"` among them — a run state can
never promote to healthy) stays could-not-check. And a funded figure
the record does not carry prints **UNKNOWN** — `totalFunded`/`netFunded` or nothing; the requested
`initialBudget` is never printed as funded (the `[W_BUDGET_FUNDED_UNREADABLE]` rule, in the check).

`status` is the other read-only one: it reads the agent's
**last deploy job** — one record, not package-addressed — so it resolves no package and fetches nothing.
An id is optional there and acts as an assertion: if the job ran a different package, `status` refuses
(naming both, and pointing at `status.py <id>` for what that package is actually doing) rather than
printing the other package's report and exit code under the id you asked about.

**The live-universe ticker gate lives in the RUNTIME.** `runDeploy` checks every hardcoded instrument in
the package (`strategy.yaml` `catalog.assets` + each instance's `scanners[].inputs`) against the live HL
instrument list **pre-money** — before it reads the backend, and on an adopt-only run too, since
installing a blind runtime on an existing wallet is the same zombie. A dead name refuses
**`[E_UNIVERSE_NOT_LIVE]`** (one refusal, every dead instrument, each with the file and key path it
appears in); when the instrument list **cannot be read** the step **fails closed** with no code and names
nothing dead — unknown is never "not live". Both branches say nothing was created **by that run**, and
that whatever the package already had is untouched (the gate stops before reading it) — relay them that
scoped way, per the rule above. `deploy.py` therefore
carries no universe gate of its own: it relays the verb's refusal verbatim, exactly like every other
`[E_*]`. `validate_universe.py` remains the standalone **read-only** check (`deploy.py validate` runs the
same predicates and reports them beside its structural verdict), and it is what the refusal points at for
the fix → re-check → deploy loop.

**Exit codes** for `validate`/`create`/`runtime`/`status` (identical to the verb's; `verify` has its
own 0/3/1 above): `0` live · `2` refused · `3` failed · `4`
installed-unobserved · `5` interrupted · `6` pending (a wallet still funding, or the job still running) ·
`1` internal/transport error. `2` is **any gate saying no with nothing created past it**: the verb's
refusals, and the wrapper's own structural preflight failing on `create`/`runtime` — the same
check `validate` runs, deterministic, so a bare retry refuses identically. `1` is also the fallback
for a status the wrapper does not recognise, so a new
status can never read as success, and for the wrapper's own "could not answer" cases: a start it could
not follow, and a `status` it could not answer as asked — an id that does not match the recorded job,
a `--ref` it has no use for, or a read that produced no snapshot at all (the verb's `[NOT_FOUND]`,
relayed verbatim; no deploy state is reported in any of them, and a re-run refuses identically).
`deploy status` sets the JOB's code before printing its snapshot, so the wrapper reads the snapshot
whatever code rides beside it — a refused or still-running job is relayed with `2`/`6`, never
discarded as an unreadable status. Branch on the code; use `--json` for anything richer.

**Plugin skew, in both directions, lands on exit `1` with nothing dispatched.** The host needs
`openclaw` + the `@senpi-ai/runtime` plugin running, and a plugin **new enough to carry the `senpi
deploy` verb**. On a box whose plugin predates it (a wedged self-update) the start fails at exit `1`
saying so: no job, no wallet, no funds, and `deploy status` has nothing to report there. Update it
(`openclaw plugins install @senpi-ai/runtime`, or wait for the box's own self-update) and re-run the
same command. The **opposite** skew lands on the same exit `1` and the same "nothing was dispatched",
and the message says which side is behind: a plugin NEWER than the box's openclaw runs the verb, has
its inner `gateway call` rejected, and is **not** fixed by installing the plugin — that one is
reported, not retried.

**Package fetch.** Any subcommand **except `verify`** (read-only: it resolves on disk or reports
could-not-check) and `status` (which resolves no package at all) fetches `strategies/<id>/` from the remote if it isn't on disk
(`_fetch.py`: GitHub tree + raw from `SENPI_SKILLS_REPO`@`SENPI_SKILLS_REF`, default
`Senpi-ai/senpi-skills`@`main`; `--ref` overrides). Fetches land in the **durable strategies root** —
`SENPI_STRATEGIES_DIR` if set, else `<OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR>/strategies`, else `/data/workspace/strategies`
on agent hosts (with a loud stderr warning on the last-resort CWD-relative dev fallback) — never inside a
managed skill dir: a package written there is destroyed on the next skill update. A bare id **resolves
from the durable root first** — that copy is the authoritative one — then CWD-relative
`strategies/<id>` as a legacy fallback, so re-running a step works from any directory.

## The report document

What `SKILL.md` means by "report from the structured output, not raw logs" — the shape, so the fields
it names are findable. Every number in it is quoted, never re-derived: `funded` is the backend's
`totalFunded`, and the tick line is the scanner row's own fields.

```jsonc
{ "strategy":"spider","version":"6.0.0","status":"live",
  "attribution":{ "skillName":"spider","skillVersion":"6.0.0" },
  "instances":[ { "instance":"swing","runtime_id":"spider-swing","wallet":"0x…","status":"live" },
                { "instance":"scalp","runtime_id":"spider-scalp","wallet":"0x…","status":"live" } ] }
```

## Worked example — "install spider"

```
user: "deploy spider with $300"
1. resolve  → id = spider (two instances: swing 60% / scalp 40%; $300 → swing $180, scalp $120)
              confirm the split with the user BEFORE funding
2. prove    → openclaw senpi validate /data/workspace/strategies/spider/swing   → PASS
              openclaw senpi validate /data/workspace/strategies/spider/scalp   → PASS
              (one run per instance; only a PASS records the proof `create` refuses without)
3. preflight→ python3 scripts/deploy.py validate spider   → structurally deploy-ready, both proven
4. start    → python3 scripts/deploy.py create spider --budget 300
              (starts the job, which refuses pre-money on a dead universe: dpl-a1b2c3d4 — phase: reconcile)
5. watch    → it polls for you; or openclaw senpi deploy status  (repeat until it is terminal)
              running (phase: create) → running (phase: install) → done — live
              (if it ends `installed-unobserved`, say the tick was not observed yet and check
               `openclaw senpi scanner -r spider-swing` in a few minutes — do NOT call it live)
6. confirm  → "🕷️ Spider is live (swing + scalp)." + the required How it runs block, e.g.:
   • Cadence — scans every 5 min (swing) / 5 min (scalp).
   • Scoring — grades tech/AI names on 4h/1h trend + smart-money consensus; opens above its score bar,
     sizing bigger at higher conviction.
   • Protection — hard stop −22% from entry; a trailing floor ratchets up locking profit from +15% to
     +80%; DSL-only, no manual exits.
```

## `close.py [<id>] [--all] [--strategy-id <id> | --address <wallet>] [--instance name] [--dry-run] [--json]`

Like deploy, close **does not block** on the async flatten — it stops + triggers, returns `closing`, and
hands polling to the agent (re-run). Discovery is ledger-free and **strategy-driven**: MCP `strategy_list`
filtered by `skillName == <id>` (resolved from `strategyMetadata.skillName`) gives the package's OPEN
strategies; **`strategyId` + wallet come straight from each strategy record** — NOT via the runtime, so
close also cleans up **orphaned** strategies (wallets a failed deploy created before its install step). The
runtime is used **only to stop** the strategy, found by wallet (`find_runtime_by_wallet`).
**`--all`** closes **every** OPEN strategy across all packages (for "close all strategies / return funds")
and deletes their runtimes. `--instance` needs the live runtime to identify an instance; if it's gone, omit it.

**`--strategy-id <id>` / `--address <wallet>`** close ONE strategy directly, bypassing package resolution
entirely — the only route for a wallet with **no package at all** (unattributed create, or app/manual —
`strategy_create_custom_strategy` does not require `skillName`/`skillVersion`, so this is reachable).
Mutually exclusive with each other, with `<id>`, and with `--all`/`--instance`/`--ref`. The read is
**unfiltered by status** (unlike `--all`/`<id>` above, which read only `LIVE_STATUSES`): a status-filtered
read can't tell "no such id" from "already closed" — both return zero rows — and either would otherwise
fall through to the generic "no OPEN strategies to close" + exit 0, a false all-clear on a target named
explicitly. Zero matches refuses instead; more than one also refuses rather than guess which to close
(wallets are 1:1 with strategies here, so this should not happen — it's a defensive backstop, not a
reachable case). Get the id/address from `status.py`.

Per strategy:

1. **Stop the runtime if one is live** — by wallet, `runtime delete`, confirm gone. Orphans skip to 2.
2. **Trigger `strategy_close(strategyId)`** — flattens **all** positions + closes the strategy (funds
   returned). Submit **only**, no wait. Only submitted while status is `ACTIVE`, so a re-run won't
   re-submit.
3. **Return `closing` immediately.** The agent polls by **re-running `close.py <id>`** — idempotent
   (runtime gone → skip; status closing/closed → skip re-submit) — which reports `closed` once the
   strategy leaves the active set (or drops out of `strategy_list`).

Close **always** closes the strategy (it never just stops the runtime). `--instance` scopes which instance(s)
to close.

## `status.py [<id>] [--fast] [--json]` — "what am I running?"

The single source of truth for the running fleet. Reads **live** `strategy_list` ∪ `openclaw runtime
list` (never the ephemeral deploy state), matches strategies to runtimes **by wallet**, and for each
running instance calls **`openclaw senpi status -r <id>`** to upgrade process-level "running" to the runtime's
own verdict + active-position count. Classes:

- **healthy / degraded / unhealthy / unknown** — ACTIVE strategy + live runtime, per the runtime's `status`
  health, which is fail-closed: `unknown` = scanner not yet proven by a tick (check, don't assume);
  the deploy report's `overall: live` is the deploy-time liveness gate — re-read it read-only with
  `openclaw senpi deploy status` (or `deploy.py verify <id>`, also read-only, for the per-instance
  verdict). The money path near this surface is the RESUME, `deploy.py runtime <id>` — that one starts
  the deploy verb and can fund/install; degraded/unknown print a read-only triage hint.
- **runtime-stopped** — ACTIVE + runtime exists but not running.
- **no-runtime** — autonomous *package* strategy (`skillName`, no `traderAddress`) with **no runtime** →
  the only no-runtime anomaly (funded but not running, likely an interrupted deploy); printed with the fix
  (`deploy.py runtime <id>` to start, or `close.py <id>` to recover funds).
- **copy** — copy-trading strategy (follows a `traderAddress`) → run by Senpi's copy engine, no runtime.
- **manual** — manual / app-managed strategy → you manage it in the app, no runtime.
- **runtime-unknown** — the host has no `openclaw`, so the registry is not visible at all. Not a
  diagnosis and **never** to be read as an interrupted deploy: check again from the runtime host.

A strategy off the runtime is **not broken** — copy/manual are managed elsewhere by design; `status.py`
prints *how* each is managed (an info line, not a warning). Only `no-runtime` (autonomous, missing runtime)
is flagged.

`--fast` skips the per-runtime `status` call (one per running instance) and reports plain `running`. It also
lists **orphan runtimes** (a runtime with no OPEN strategy → safe to `runtime delete`). Grouped by
package; `<id>` filters. Answer "what am I running / list my strategies / is my fleet healthy" with this,
not by hand-composing `strategy_list`.

## Runtime CLI surface used (from `senpi-trading-runtime/references/runtime-cli.md`)

| Command | Used for |
|---|---|
| `openclaw senpi deploy -p <dir> …` / `deploy status [--json]` | the deploy verb + its read-only report — started via `deploy.py` (the funded path) |
| `openclaw senpi runtime list` — text output only, it takes no `--json` | reverse lookup, close discovery, `status.py` fleet view |
| `openclaw senpi runtime delete --id <id> --address <wallet>` | close step 1, orphan-runtime cleanup |
| `openclaw senpi status -r <id> [--json]` / `state -r <id> [--json]` | Monitor (scanner ticked) |
| `openclaw senpi dsl positions\|inspect\|closes` · `action list\|history\|decisions` | troubleshooting |

There is deliberately **no `runtime create` row**: install is the deploy verb's own step 4, done
in-process — the verb never shells out to it, and running it by hand skips the funds preflight, the
attribution and the observed tick. Pasted as content (`-c`, no `--runtime-yaml-dir`) it also leaves a
relative scanner path nothing to resolve against and the install gate refuses
`[E_VALIDATE_UNRESOLVABLE_SCANNER_PATH]`; `-p <file>` derives that directory from the file, so it is
the content form specifically that breaks.

## MCP tools used (via `mcp_client.py`)

`strategy_create_custom_strategy` (create wallet) · `strategy_list` (poll ACTIVE/CLOSED, reverse lookup) ·
`strategy_close` (flatten + close) · optionally `strategy_get` / `strategy_get_clearinghouse_state` to
cross-check zero open positions. Note: `timeout=` on a call is the **HTTP request** timeout, not the
async on-chain completion time — lifecycle ops submit then poll.
