# Projects Reference

Project pages at [bankr.bot/terminal/projects](https://bankr.bot/terminal/projects) showcase a project: its description, team, token data with a live chart and market cap, weekly fee revenue, products, update timeline, GitHub activity, Ethos credibility and recent X posts. Docs: [docs.bankr.bot/projects/overview](https://docs.bankr.bot/projects/overview).

> **The CLI says `project`, the API says `profile`.** The command is `bankr project`, but the REST paths (`/agent/profile`, `/agent-profiles`), the JSON field names and the socket events all use "profile".

## Creating a Project

Only `projectName` is required, and a wallet can hold several projects.

- **Linking a token is optional.** To link one, the wallet must have launched it through Bankr or be one of its fee beneficiaries (Bankr's own fee wallets never qualify). An ineligible token is refused with `403`. Check first with `GET /agent/profile/token-eligibility?address=0x…`, which answers `200` with `eligible: false` rather than an error, because part of the check is on-chain.
- **Derived fields aren't accepted as input:** `tokenChainId` (one of base, ethereum, polygon, solana, robinhood, arbitrum) and `tokenSymbol` come from the token, `tokenName` too unless you set it, and `twitterUsername` comes from the wallet's linked X account. That X account also supplies `profileImageUrl` when you don't send one.
- **Everything else is optional:** `description` (up to 2,000 characters), `website`, `profileImageUrl`, `teamMembers` (up to 20, each with up to 10 links), `products` and `revenueSources` (up to 20 each), `projectImages` (up to 3 URLs), `tags` (up to 10) and `isPublished`. The [OpenAPI spec](https://docs.bankr.bot/openapi/api.yaml) has every field and limit.

## Review and Visibility

A new project is a **draft** (`isPublished: false`) that only its owner can see. Publishing it (`isPublished: true`, or the Publish toggle in the web form) submits it for review, and Bankr approves projects for the public listing. An unpublished project can't be approved, and unpublishing an approved project hides it from every public surface until it's published again. The owner's view of a project carries `reviewStatus`: `draft`, `pending`, `approved` or `declined`. A declined project stays unlisted; the owner has to contact the Bankr team for another review.

Approved, published projects appear in the listing and get their market cap refreshed every 5 minutes and their weekly fee revenue every 30 minutes.

## CLI

```bash
bankr project [--json]                               # view your projects
bankr project create                                 # interactive
bankr project create --name "My Agent" --description "AI trading agent" \
  --token 0x1234...abcd --image https://example.com/logo.png --website https://myagent.xyz
bankr project update --description "Updated description"   # also --name, --token, --image, --website
bankr project add-update --title "v2 Launch" --content "Shipped a new swap engine"
bankr project delete                                 # asks for confirmation
```

- With more than one project, `update`, `add-update` and `delete` ask which one. Pass `--slug <slug>` when running non-interactively.
- The CLI can't publish a project or set team members, products, revenue sources, tags or images. Use the web form or the REST API for those, so a project created from the CLI stays a draft until then.
- **Updates** form a timeline on the project page. Each has a title (up to 200 characters) and content (up to 5,000), and only the newest 50 are kept.

## REST API

`/agent/profile` needs an API key (`X-API-Key`) with Agent API access. These routes follow the single-profile contract unless you pass `multi=true`:

| Request | Without `multi` | With `?multi=true` |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------|
| `GET /agent/profile` | The most recently created profile, or `404` if the wallet has none | An array of the wallet's profiles (up to 50, newest first) |
| `POST /agent/profile` | `409` if the wallet already has one | Creates another profile |

Once a wallet holds more than one, writes take the project's slug: `PUT /agent/profile/{slug}` (send only the fields to change; `null` unlinks the token or clears the website, image or token name), `DELETE /agent/profile/{slug}` and `POST /agent/profile/{slug}/update` (a timeline entry). The slugless forms address the wallet's most recently created profile. Request and response shapes are in the [OpenAPI spec](https://docs.bankr.bot/openapi/api.yaml).

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bankr.bot/agent/profile?multi=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectName": "My Agent", "tokenAddress": "0x...", "isPublished": true}'
```

## Public Endpoints (No Auth)

| Method | Path | Returns |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles` | Approved, published projects. Query: `limit` (1-100, default 20), `offset`, `sort` (`marketCap` or `newest`), `q` (matches name, token symbol and tags), and `includeFeatured=1`, which adds every featured project to the first unfiltered page, so that page can run past `limit` |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}` | Detail by token address or slug. An unapproved or unpublished project is shown only to its owner's API key |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}/market-cap` | Live market cap |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}/llm-usage` | LLM gateway usage over `days` (1-90, default 30): `totals`, `byModel`, `daily`. No cost data. Cached 5 minutes |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}/x402-revenue` | Revenue and request totals of the wallet's live x402 endpoints |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}/skills` | Public skills the wallet has published |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}/github-activity` | Activity of the linked GitHub repo (below) |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}/ethos` | Ethos credibility cards (below) |
| `GET` | `/agent-profiles/{identifier}/tweets` | Up to 10 recent original posts (no replies or reposts) from the linked X account, cached for 2 hours. Empty when no account is linked or the fetch fails |

Field-level response shapes: [REST API reference](https://docs.bankr.bot/projects/rest-api).

### Derived cards

Both cards come from links the project already has; there is nothing extra to configure. They are served for approved, published projects only, cached, and rate-limited per IP.

- **GitHub activity** uses the first `github.com/{owner}/{repo}` URL found in `website`, then the product URLs, then team-member links, so put the repo you want in `website`. `activity` is `null` when no repo is linked. `stats` is `null` when GitHub was unreachable or rate-limited, and the repo link still resolves, so a null `stats` doesn't mean "no repo". `commits` covers the last 52 weeks and `pullRequests` / `releases` the last 12 months; each can be `null` while GitHub is still computing it. `repo.verified` means the owner's linked GitHub account owns or maintains the repo, and `weekly` holds up to 52 buckets, oldest first.
- **Ethos** returns a card for the project's linked X account first, then for up to five team members whose links include an X profile, deduplicated by Ethos username. Accounts without an Ethos profile are left out, so an empty `cards` array isn't an error. `reviews.positivePercent` is `null` until there is at least one review, and `reviews.items` holds at most three, newest first.

## Real-Time Updates

The `/agent-profiles` Socket.IO namespace on `api.bankr.bot` pushes changes to approved, published projects:

- `AGENT_PROFILE_UPDATE` carries listing changes such as market cap and revenue.
- `AGENT_PROFILE_DETAIL_UPDATE` carries detail-page changes. Subscribe with `socket.emit("subscribe", key)`, where `key` is the project's **token address**, or its slug if it has no token. Leave with `unsubscribe`.
