# Module: Advanced Features

> This module is loaded on-demand by the Bybit Trading Skill. Authentication required for most endpoints.
>
> **Execution Constraints:** this module contains many state-changing endpoints. On Mainnet every one of them MUST go through the **Structured Operation Confirmation** flow in SKILL.md — present the confirmation card and wait for the user to type `CONFIRM` before sending the request. This applies to all of them, not only the ones with extra notes below: crypto-loan borrow / supply / repay / repay-collateral / renew / order-cancel / adjust-ltv, institutional-loan association-uid and repay-loan, RFQ create-rfq / create-quote / execute-quote / accept-other-quote / cancel-*, spread order create / amend / cancel, and broker apilimit/set. `One CONFIRM = one operation` — a confirmation authorizes exactly the amounts and params shown on the card the user just saw; if anything changes after they confirm, show a delta card and wait for a fresh `CONFIRM`.
>
> **Exception — `POST /v5/crypto-loan-common/max-loan` is read-only** ("calculate max borrowable amount"). It uses POST only to carry a `collateralList` body and changes no state, so it needs **no** confirmation on any environment. Do not gate a risk calculation behind `CONFIRM`.
>
> Borrow operations additionally require risk disclosure on the card — see **Borrow confirmation card** below.

## Crypto Loan

| Endpoint | Path | Method | Required Params | Optional Params | Auth | Status |

### Crypto Loan — Common (authentication required)

| Endpoint | Path | Method | Required Params | Optional Params |
|----------|------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Position | `/v5/crypto-loan-common/position` | GET | — | — |
| Collateral Data | `/v5/crypto-loan-common/collateral-data` | GET | — | — |
| Loanable Data | `/v5/crypto-loan-common/loanable-data` | GET | — | — |
| Max Collateral Amount | `/v5/crypto-loan-common/max-collateral-amount` | GET | currency | — |
| Max Loan | `/v5/crypto-loan-common/max-loan` | POST | currency, collateralList | — |
| Adjust LTV | `/v5/crypto-loan-common/adjust-ltv` | POST | currency, amount, direction | — |
| Adjustment History | `/v5/crypto-loan-common/adjustment-history` | GET | — | currency, limit, cursor |

> **`loanable-data` is where interest rates live** — `flexibleAnnualizedInterestRate` (flexible loans) and `annualizedInterestRate7D`/`14D`/`30D`/`60D`/`90D`/`180D` (fixed terms), plus `minFlexibleBorrowingAmount` and `flexibleBorrowingAccuracy`. Quote rates from here. The `available-inventory` endpoints in the Fixed Term / Flexible sections return **pool capacity only** and carry no rate.

> ⚠️ **`collateralList` item field name differs between endpoints.** `max-loan` uses **`ccy`**; both `crypto-loan-fixed/borrow` and `crypto-loan-flexible/borrow` use **`currency`**. Since the natural flow is *check max-loan → then borrow*, do **not** reuse the same JSON array across the two calls — rename the key, or the borrow request fails with a params error.

### Borrow confirmation card (applies to both fixed and flexible borrow)

Borrowing creates a **debt liability plus a collateral lock**, and collateral can be liquidated. Mainnet borrow MUST use the Structured Operation Confirmation flow, and the card MUST show enough for the user to judge the risk — not just the amount. Include:

| On the card | Source |
|---|---|
| Loan currency + amount | the user's request (`loanCurrency`/`orderCurrency`, `loanAmount`/`orderAmount`) |
| **Every** collateral currency + amount | the user's request (`collateralList[]`) — list each one, never summarize as "collateral" |
| Current interest rate | `GET /v5/crypto-loan-common/loanable-data` → `flexibleAnnualizedInterestRate` (flexible) or `annualizedInterestRate<term>` (fixed). **For flexible, state that the rate floats hourly and the shown figure is the rate at this moment.** |
| Applicable collateral ratio (the ceiling that bounds the loan) | `GET /v5/crypto-loan-common/collateral-data` → `collateralRatioConfigList[].collateralRatioList[]`, pick the tier whose `minValue`–`maxValue` band contains the collateral's USD value; show that tier's `collateralRatio` |
| Which collateral gets sold first if liquidation happens | same endpoint → `currencyLiquidationList[].liquidationOrder` (lower = liquidated earlier) |
| Headroom (optional but preferred) | `POST /v5/crypto-loan-common/max-loan` with `currency` + `collateralList[{ccy, amount}]` — note the `ccy` key |
| Term + repayment terms (fixed only) | the user's request: `term`, `autoRepay`, `repayType` |

**Do not invent a liquidation price or a "liquidation threshold" figure — no such field exists in the API.** The retrievable risk quantities are the tiered `collateralRatio` and `liquidationOrder` above. Post-borrow, `GET /v5/crypto-loan-common/position` returns the live `ltv` (`totalDebt / totalCollateral`, `"0"` when there are no active loans) — use that for ongoing monitoring, and tell the user they can watch it there. If the rate or collateral ratio cannot be fetched, say so on the card rather than omitting the line silently or guessing a number.

Server-side guard, not a substitute for the card: `148009` means the LTV would exceed the allowed threshold and the borrow is rejected.

### Crypto Loan — Fixed Term (authentication required)

| Endpoint | Path | Method | Required Params | Optional Params |
|----------|------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Borrow Contract Info | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/borrow-contract-info` | GET | orderCurrency | — |
| Borrow Order Quote | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/borrow-order-quote` | GET | orderCurrency | orderBy |
| Available Inventory | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/available-inventory` | GET | currency, term, annualRate | — |
| Place Borrow | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/borrow` | POST | orderCurrency, orderAmount, annualRate, term, collateralList | autoRepay, repayType, strategyType |
| Borrow Order Info | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/borrow-order-info` | GET | — | orderId |
| Cancel Borrow | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/borrow-order-cancel` | POST | orderId | — |
| Full Repay | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/fully-repay` | POST | orderId | — |
| Repay Collateral | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/repay-collateral` | POST | orderId | — |
| Repayment History | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/repayment-history` | GET | — | repayId |

> **Fixed-term borrow is a Mainnet write with a term commitment** — `POST /v5/crypto-loan-fixed/borrow` locks collateral for the chosen `term`. Follow the Structured Operation Confirmation flow and use the **Borrow confirmation card** contents above; `annualRate` is the rate the user is committing to, so show it explicitly alongside the term and `autoRepay`/`repayType`.
| Renewal Info | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/renew-info` | GET | orderId | — |
| Renew | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/renew` | POST | orderId | — |
| Supply Contract Info | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/supply-contract-info` | GET | supplyCurrency | — |
| Supply Order Quote | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/supply-order-quote` | GET | orderCurrency | orderBy |
| Supply Order Info | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/supply-order-info` | GET | — | orderId |
| Place Supply | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/supply` | POST | orderCurrency, orderAmount, annualRate, term | availableSource |
| Cancel Supply | `/v5/crypto-loan-fixed/supply-order-cancel` | POST | orderId | refundedAccount |

> **Place Supply `availableSource`**: `0` funding account (default), `1` flexible savings, `2` mixed (funding + flexible savings).
> **Cancel Supply `refundedAccount`** (only effective when order was placed from flexible savings): `0` redeem to funding account (default), `1` keep in flexible savings (unfreeze).
> **Place Borrow `term`**: `7|14|30|60|90|180` (days). `autoRepay`: `0` manual, `1` auto-repay. `repayType`: `1` normal repay. `strategyType`: `PARTIAL` allow partial fill (default) | `FULL` full fill only. `collateralList` is a non-empty array of `{currency, amount}`. Check Borrow Order Quote for available rates first.
> **Available Inventory `term`**: `7|14|30|90|180` (days); `annualRate` decimal (e.g. `0.02` = 2%). Returns lending-pool `availableInventory` = min(market available + financial trial, user remaining borrow limit).
> **Error `148048`**: "The collateral amount has exceeded the platform limit" — applies to borrow, renew, and adjust-LTV operations.

### Crypto Loan — Flexible (authentication required)

| Endpoint | Path | Method | Required Params | Optional Params |
|----------|------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Place Borrow | `/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/borrow` | POST | loanCurrency, loanAmount, collateralList | — |
| Repay | `/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/repay` | POST | loanCoin, repayAmount | — |
| Repay Collateral | `/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/repay-collateral` | POST | orderId | — |
| Available Inventory | `/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/available-inventory` | GET | currency | — |
| Ongoing Coins | `/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/ongoing-coin` | GET | — | loanCurrency |
| Borrow History | `/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/borrow-history` | GET | — | orderId, loanCurrency, limit, cursor |
| Repayment History | `/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/repayment-history` | GET | — | repayId, loanCurrency, limit, cursor |

**Place Borrow notes** (`/v5/crypto-loan-flexible/borrow`)

Flexible = hourly floating rate, repay anytime with no penalty, interest accrued on actual duration. Use this instead of `crypto-loan-fixed/borrow` when the user wants short-term or open-ended borrowing.

- `loanCurrency`: currency to borrow (`USDT`, `BTC`, `ETH`, …) · `loanAmount`: full-precision string
- `collateralList`: array, each item requires **both** `currency` and `amount` (full-precision strings). Multiple collateral currencies are supported.
- Returns `result.orderId` — use it with `borrow-history` to track the order
- Rate limit: **1 request per time window per UID** — verified on testnet: firing several borrow calls back to back returns `10006 Too many visits` from the second one onward. Space retries out; do not loop.
- **Rate, minimum and precision come from `GET /v5/crypto-loan-common/loanable-data`** — fields `flexibleAnnualizedInterestRate`, `minFlexibleBorrowingAmount`, `flexibleBorrowingAccuracy`. Quote the rate from there before showing the confirmation card, and use the minimum/precision to avoid `148002` / `148003`.
- `available-inventory` returns **only pool capacity** (`currency`, `availableInventory`, `updateTime`) — **it carries no rate.** Use it to check the pool can cover the amount, never to quote an interest rate.
- Compute LTV before borrowing — the rate floats hourly, so re-read it if the user takes a while to confirm
- **Mainnet: follow the Structured Operation Confirmation flow — see "Borrow confirmation card" above for what the card MUST show.** Borrowing creates a debt liability and locks collateral that can be liquidated; do not send this request before the user types `CONFIRM`.

```
POST /v5/crypto-loan-flexible/borrow
{"loanCurrency":"USDT","loanAmount":"10000","collateralList":[{"currency":"BTC","amount":"0.5"}]}
```

⚠️ **`retMsg` for these codes is a SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier, not prose** — e.g. `148001` → `TOKEN_NOT_SUPPORT_FLEXIBLE_LOAN`, `148002` → `LOAN_QUANTITY_NOT_ALLOWED`, `10001` → `ILLEGAL_PARAMETER` (verified on testnet). Branch on `retCode`, never on `retMsg` text. Also note the checks short-circuit: an invalid `loanAmount` is rejected before the collateral is looked at, so a `148002` does not mean the rest of the body was accepted.

Error codes: `148001` currency not supported for flexible loan · `148002` amount below minimum · `148003` amount exceeds precision · `148004` collateral currency not supported · `148005` collateral amount exceeds precision · `148009` LTV exceeds threshold · `148010` insufficient user quota · `148011` insufficient lending pool balance · `148012` insufficient collateral amount · `148013` non-borrowing users cannot operate · `148014` currency not supported · `148020` insufficient platform quota · `148021` operation conflict · `148031` operation not allowed during liquidation · `148048` collateral amount exceeded platform limit (transfer in other supported assets as collateral) · `100109` copy-trading users cannot use crypto loan · `10006` rate limit exceeded · `10016` server error.

### Spread Trade — Max Qty Notes

- **Purpose**: Query the spread wallet available balance (`ab`) for a given symbol and side before placing an order. Use this to validate order size against available funds.
- **`side` enum**: `1` = Buy, `2` = Sell
- **`ab` field**: Returned available balance is truncated to 8 decimal places (not rounded).
- **Typical flow**: Call `/v5/spread/max-qty` with the target `symbol`, `side`, and intended `orderPrice` → use the returned `ab` to determine the maximum allowable qty → then call `/v5/spread/order/create`.

## Broker (authentication required)

| Endpoint | Path | Method | Required Params | Optional Params |
|----------|------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Earnings Info | `/v5/broker/earnings-info` | GET | — | bizType, begin, end, uid, limit, cursor |
| Account Info | `/v5/broker/account-info` | GET | — | — |
| Voucher Info | `/v5/broker/award/info` | GET | awardId | — |
| Distribution Record | `/v5/broker/award/distribution-record` | GET | — | awardId, startTime, endTime, limit, cursor |

| Rate Limit Cap | `/v5/broker/apilimit/query-cap` | GET | — | — |
| Set Rate Limit | `/v5/broker/apilimit/set` | POST | list | — |

### Earnings Info (`/v5/broker/earnings-info`)
- **Date params are `begin` / `end`, NOT `startTime` / `endTime`**, and the format is `YYYYMMDD` (e.g. `"20240131"`), not milliseconds. They must be supplied **together or not at all** (`3500407` otherwise); omitting both returns the latest 7 days.
- `bizType`: `SPOT` | `DERIVATIVES` | `OPTIONS` | `CONVERT`. If not provided, all types are returned.
- `uid`: broker subaccount UID. If not provided, returns data for all subaccounts.
- `limit`: `1`–`1000` (out of range → `3500402`). `cursor`: use `nextPageCursor` from the previous response, **URL-encoded**. An empty `nextPageCursor` means last page.
- Requires an **exchange broker master account** (`3500403` otherwise). Data covers up to the past 1 month until T-1 (`3500406` if the range exceeds it); older data requires contacting your Relationship Manager.
- `details[].earning` is the **total** commission and equals `baseFeeEarning + markupEarning`. Rebate amounts have trailing zeros stripped.
- `totalEarningCat` groups totals by business type (`spot`, `derivatives`, `options`, `convert`, `total`) within the queried range; `total` is aggregated by coin across all types.
- Error codes: `3500402` invalid `limit` · `3500403` not an exchange broker master account · `3500404` invalid cursor · `3500406` out of query time range · `3500407` `begin`/`end` not supplied as a pair.
