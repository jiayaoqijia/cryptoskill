"""senpi-improve-trades engine — retrospective trade-review + coaching data work (hidden).

The agent (LLM) runs this via the OpenClaw `exec` tool, reads the JSON on stdout, and NARRATES a
disciplined trade review + improvement coaching under the SKILL.md guardrails. This script does the
precise, deterministic data work — reconstruct every CLOSED trade, attribute its exit mechanism, compute
the honest "if I'd held to now" counterfactual, and cross the book against what the market did — and the
LLM does the prose, the process-framing, and the fix-depth CTAs.

  python3 review.py                        # last ~7d review (all strategy wallets)
  python3 review.py --window 30            # last 30 days
  python3 review.py --last 20              # cap to the last 20 closed trades (per wallet)
  python3 review.py --no-market            # skip the current-price / book-vs-market pull
  python3 review.py --fixture f.json       # offline: recorded MCP-response map (tests)
  python3 review.py --dry                  # dump raw MCP responses for schema debugging

WHY THIS EXISTS — the anti-fabrication mechanism:
Live agents answering "did I sell too early?" fall into hindsight bias (grading an exit "wrong" because
the asset later reversed), invent forward "+$X/week" projections, and confuse the USER with the
autonomous STRATEGY that actually exited the trade. This engine computes the timing table + the
market-gap FOR the LLM so it cannot skip the entry->exit->current-price comparison or invent forward
numbers — it narrates real, engine-computed values. It reports realized PnL + engine counterfactuals
(if_held, if_all_reclosed_now) as PROCESS-framed COUNTS, never a $/week projection.

SOURCE BOUNDARY (telemetry-ready): trades[] are assembled behind a single `_collect_trades()` step that
fuses discovery_get_trader_history + ratchet_stop_list + market prices. Each trade carries a `source`
tag ("reconstructed"). v2 telemetry (the successor to the removed audit_* tools) slots in HERE as an
additional/primary trade+exit source without touching the narration, the guardrails, or the output shape.

⚠ All tools here are USER-scoped (your own account): needs a USER-scoped SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN.

    """THE SOURCE BOUNDARY — onchain data → discovery; runtime events → telemetry.

    DISCOVERY OWNS THE TRADE LIST + every onchain fact. `fetch_closed_trades` (discovery_get_trader_history)
    is the trade source, untouched — asset, entry/exit px, realized PnL, direction, timing, closedOrderId
    all come from there and are never re-derived. `market_get_asset_data` supplies the current price for
    the honest "if I'd held to now" counterfactual.

    TELEMETRY (the runtime event log) ENRICHES those discovery trades: it fills each trade's EXIT REASON
    (`dsl.closed` / `position.closed` close_reason + tier + roe) and produces the standalone telemetry
    streams — `missed_signals[]` (blocked/rejected `signal.outcome` — 'what did I miss'), plus the leak +
    execution-quality rollups ('where am I leaking', 'fees maker vs taker'). ALL of these reuse the SAME
    per-runtime events fetched ONCE here (no re-fetch). Telemetry NEVER reconstructs a trade or re-derives a
    price/PnL. Exit-reason match priority: exact order_id → else asset+close_time within ±2min; no telemetry
    match → the ratchet record (SECONDARY fallback) → else UNKNOWN. Telemetry wins when present.

    PERFORMANCE — two parallel phases (output shape + values IDENTICAL to the old sequential form):
      Phase 1 — per-strategy fan-out on a ThreadPoolExecutor (max 8 workers). Each worker fully processes
        ONE strategy (fetch_closed_trades + _fetch_events → missed_signals + leak/fill deltas +
        _load_ratchet_records + the per-trade exit_reason match), but DEFERS the price/`_if_held` step. Each
        worker runs against a PRIVATE meta and returns local leak/fill deltas — no shared mutable state is
        written from threads. Results merge in the MAIN thread deterministically: strategies iterated in
        their original order, trades concatenated, leaks/fills summed per-strategy, warnings concatenated in
        order. Each worker is wrapped fail-open (one strategy's failure contributes empty, never crashes).
      Phase 2 — dedupe + parallelize the price fetches. The unique (asset, dex) set across all collected
        trades is priced ONCE each (small pool → {(asset,dex): price} cache), then `_if_held` is applied to
        every trade from the cache. This collapses the old per-trade sequential price calls (3× JPY → 1).
        Skipped entirely when want_market is False (price_now stays None, exit_vs_hold 'unknown').

    field/stream, not the whole trade; zero telemetry → discovery path is fully intact + empty aggregates."""
