"""Offline engine test — runs portfolio.run() against a recorded MCP fixture (no network).

The fixture reproduces the canonical bug scenario: embedded wallet holds ~$0 idle, all funds are in
strategies, and `total_withdrawable` is large. The test guards that the engine reports those as
SEPARATE buckets and never collapses strategy-margin into "embedded idle."
