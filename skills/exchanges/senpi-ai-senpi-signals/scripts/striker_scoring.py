"""ORCA — pure thesis math (no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

A faithful Runtime 3.0 port of the v2 ORCA producer's Gen-1 Vanilla Striker
detection (`detect_signals` body + `time_of_day_modifier` + `check_4h_alignment`),
SKILL.md / orca-producer.py v4.0.1. The arithmetic, gate order, point weights, and
direction logic are reproduced VERBATIM so a fidelity harness can diff this against
the v2 producer on the same scan snapshot.

Behaviour-preserving quirks from v2 are kept and flagged `# v2-quirk`. Fix them only
as a separate, labelled change AFTER the port is validated.

UNIVERSE scanner: `score_market` scores ONE normalized market dict against the
previous scan + a short rank-history window (FIRST_JUMP / IMMEDIATE_MOVER / contrib
explosion / velocity / climbing). The caller (scan.py) iterates the top-50 SM
leaderboard markets, maintains the scan history in ctx.state, picks the single
strongest candidate, and resolves the fixed-7x leverage. Unit-testable on plain dicts.

The ONE non-pure thing the v2 detect_signals did — `time_of_day_modifier()` reads the
wall clock — is parameterized here: the caller passes the current UTC hour in so this
module stays clock-free and unit-testable. The US-session arithmetic is verbatim.

    structural change: the rank-history lookups (latest_prev market, oldest market,
