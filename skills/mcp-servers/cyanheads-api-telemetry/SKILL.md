  Catalog of OpenTelemetry instrumentation built into framework `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core` — spans, metrics, completion logs, env config, runtime caveats, custom instrumentation patterns, and cardinality rules. Use when enabling OTel export, adding custom spans or metrics in services, debugging missing telemetry, looking up attribute names, or deciding what's safe to put on a metric attribute vs. a span.

## Overview

The framework auto-instruments every tool, resource, prompt, storage, LLM, speech, and graph call — each gets its own span and the standard counters/histograms. HTTP server requests pick up spans from `HttpInstrumentation` (all Node.js HTTP traffic, skips `/healthz`) plus `httpInstrumentationMiddleware` from `@hono/otel` on the MCP HTTP endpoint when installed (optional Tier 3 peer — `bun add @hono/otel`). On Bun, `HttpInstrumentation` silently no-ops and `@hono/otel` is the only HTTP coverage. Auth checks and session lifecycle are tracked as **metrics only** — auth decorates the active HTTP span with attributes, sessions emit counters.

`requestId`, `traceId`, and `tenantId` correlate automatically across spans, metrics, and logs. Framework log records carry `traceId`/`spanId` from the request context.

A handler's `ctx.traceId` / `ctx.spanId` name the execution span it runs in — `tool_execution:<name>` or `resource_read:<name>` — not the enclosing HTTP request span. Under HTTP the trace ID is the request's, so handler logs join to the request; the span ID is the child execution's, so they join to that span's attributes and duration. On stdio, where no transport span exists, both are still populated from the execution span the framework opens. Both are `undefined` when telemetry is disabled: the non-recording span a disabled pipeline produces carries all-zero IDs, and the framework reports no correlation rather than IDs that correlate to nothing.

For the helper API surface (`withSpan`, `createCounter`, `createHistogram`, `buildTraceparent`, etc.) — see the `api-utils` skill, `Telemetry` section. This skill is the catalog of **what** is emitted; that one is the reference for **how** to emit your own.

## Enabling export

OTel is **off by default**. `OTEL_ENABLED=true` alone does nothing — you also need an OTLP endpoint. Without an endpoint the SDK is configured but nothing leaves the process.

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| `OTEL_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch. Must be `true` to start the SDK. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | — | OTLP/HTTP base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:4318`). Traces go to `<base>/v1/traces`, metrics to `<base>/v1/metrics`; a path prefix is kept. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | — | OTLP/HTTP traces endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`). Overrides the base for traces; used as-is. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | — | OTLP/HTTP metrics endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics`). Overrides the base for metrics; used as-is. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` | — | OTLP/HTTP logs endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:4318/v1/logs`). Opt-in log export; used as-is and never derived from the base. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `createApp` `name` → `package.json` `name` | `service.name` resource attribute. Seeded from `createApp({ name })` when unset; an env value wins. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION` | `package.json` `version` | `service.version` resource attribute. |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` | `1.0` | Trace sampling ratio (0–1) for `TraceIdRatioBasedSampler`. |
| `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | OTel diagnostic logger level (`NONE`/`ERROR`/`WARN`/`INFO`/`DEBUG`/`VERBOSE`/`ALL`; `warning`/`err`/`information` accepted). Diag output goes to stderr at every level, never stdout. |

Metrics push via `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` every **15 seconds**. Traces use `BatchSpanProcessor`.

Traces and metrics endpoints resolve per the [OTLP exporter spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/#endpoint-urls-for-otlphttp): the signal-specific variable as-is, else the base plus the signal path. A signal with no resolved endpoint exports nothing, and `NodeSDK`'s own `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` / `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` defaults are not consulted.

Log records export only when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` is set. The base endpoint alone never turns it on, so a deployment exporting traces and metrics keeps its logs local until it opts in. When set, every record the framework logger writes — after the `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` filter and the rate limit, with the same fields as the pino output (the error argument as the `exception.*` attributes rather than an `err` field), redacted the same way — is also sent through a `BatchLogRecordProcessor`, with its MCP level as the severity and the active span's trace context (a handler's `ctx.log` record joins its `tool_execution:*` span). `interactions.log` transcripts are never exported. Log export needs three more optional peers: `bun add @opentelemetry/sdk-logs @opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-http @opentelemetry/api-logs`.

---

## Runtime support

| Runtime | Behavior |
|:--------|:---------|
| **Node.js / Bun** | Full `NodeSDK`. Auto-instrumentations: HTTP server (Node http hooks; skips `/healthz`), and Pino, which patches only a `pino` loaded after the SDK starts — never the framework logger's, imported first. On the HTTP transport, when OTel is enabled and `@hono/otel` is installed, `httpInstrumentationMiddleware` is also wired onto the MCP endpoint — fills the gap on Bun, where the Node http auto-instrumentation silently no-ops. Manual spans, custom metrics, and OTLP export work on Bun regardless. |
| **Cloudflare Workers / V8 isolates** | `NodeSDK` is unavailable. SDK init no-ops silently. `createCounter`/`createHistogram`/`withSpan` calls still work via the global OTel API but produce no output unless you wire a Worker-compatible exporter and `ctx.waitUntil()` for flush. |

Cloud platform detection auto-populates resource attributes:

| Detected | Attributes set |
|:---------|:--------------|
| Cloudflare Workers | `cloud.provider=cloudflare`, `cloud.platform=cloudflare_workers` |
| AWS Lambda | `cloud.provider=aws`, `cloud.platform=aws_lambda`, `cloud.region` from `AWS_REGION` |
| GCP Cloud Run / Functions | `cloud.provider=gcp`, `cloud.platform=gcp_cloud_run` (or `gcp_cloud_functions`), `cloud.region` from `GCP_REGION` |
| All | `deployment.environment.name` from `config.environment` |

---

## Flush at exit

Spans batch and metrics push on a 15-second cycle, so a process that exits between cycles takes its telemetry with it. `ServerHandle.shutdown()` is the drain: it stops the transport, runs the `teardown` hook, then force-flushes traces and metrics through the OTLP exporters and closes the logger.

A failed flush is logged as a warning and the logger still closes, so the final log lines survive. The usual cause is an exporter that can't reach its collector and hits the 5 s OTel shutdown ceiling.

| Trigger | Path | Exit |
|:--------|:-----|:-----|
| `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` | `shutdown(signal)`, then an explicit exit | `0`, or `1` when the backstop fires |
| `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection` | `shutdown(signal)`, then an explicit exit | `1` |
| stdin EOF, stdio transport | the SDK transport closes itself, aborting in-flight requests unanswered; then `shutdown('STDIN_EOF')` and an explicit exit | `0`, backstop or not |
| a second signal during shutdown | none — the handlers are already detached | the OS default (`143` / `130`) |
| `ServerHandle.shutdown()` called directly | the same drain | none — exit-free by contract |

**A signal ends the process.** Every exit-bearing path runs the cleanup exactly once — shutdown detaches the signal handlers and the EOF watcher as it starts, so neither can re-enter it — and then exits explicitly instead of waiting to run out of handles. Two things follow: the OTLP export leaves the process, and a handle registered outside framework teardown (a recursive `fs.watch`, a `setInterval` without `unref()`) can no longer keep the server resident. A second signal arriving mid-shutdown reaches no handler, so the default disposition terminates immediately — the operator's force-kill escape hatch. Neither path writes to stdout.

**The drain is bounded.** Shutdown-on-exit races a 10-second backstop that bounds the shutdown as a whole, not any single await: a step that settles inside the ceiling is never truncated, and only one that never settles is cut. A signal cut exits 1 after a warning naming that step; a stdin-EOF cut exits 0 without one. The logger bounds its own flush separately, per pino instance: a completing callback is awaited in full, and a runtime whose callback never arrives releases shutdown rather than hanging it.

**Release what the framework cannot see.** `createApp({ teardown })` is the `setup` counterpart: it runs after the transport stops and before the logger closes, on every shutdown path, with `CoreServices` still alive. Close a watcher, socket, or poller there rather than leaving it for the backstop, which cuts a ref'd handle rather than closing it. An error it raises is logged and never blocks the exit; a hook that never settles is what the ceiling then bounds. Node/Bun only — `createWorkerHandler` does not accept it.

Workers has no `ServerHandle` and no `NodeSDK` — flush whatever exporter you wired there yourself, via `ctx.waitUntil()`.

## Spans

Every handler call gets a span. Nested operations (storage, graph, LLM) become child spans on the same trace. All spans carry `code.function.name` and `code.namespace` for code-attribution. Errors are recorded via `span.recordException()` and `SpanStatusCode.ERROR`; `McpError` codes surface as the `*.error_code` attribute.

| Span name | Source | Key attributes |
|:----------|:-------|:---------------|
| `tool_execution:<tool>` | every tool call | `mcp.tool.input_bytes`, `mcp.tool.output_bytes`, `mcp.tool.duration_ms`, `mcp.tool.success`, `mcp.tool.error_code`, `mcp.tool.input_required`, `mcp.tool.partial_success`, `mcp.tool.batch.{succeeded,failed}_count` |
| `resource_read:<resource>` | every resource handler | `mcp.resource.uri` (userinfo, query, and fragment stripped, then cut to its first 1,024 characters), `mcp.resource.uri_length` (the uncut length, only when the cut removed something), `mcp.resource.mime_type`, `mcp.resource.size_bytes`, `mcp.resource.duration_ms`, `mcp.resource.success`, `mcp.resource.error_code`, `mcp.resource.input_required` |
| `prompt_generation:<prompt>` | every prompt handler | `mcp.prompt.input_bytes`, `mcp.prompt.output_bytes`, `mcp.prompt.message_count`, `mcp.prompt.duration_ms`, `mcp.prompt.success`, `mcp.prompt.error_code`, `mcp.prompt.input_required` |
| `storage:<op>` | `StorageService` (every call) | `mcp.storage.operation`, `mcp.storage.duration_ms`, `mcp.storage.success`, `mcp.storage.key_count` (batch ops) |
| `graph:<op>` | `GraphService` (every call) | `mcp.graph.operation`, `mcp.graph.duration_ms`, `mcp.graph.success` |
| `gen_ai.chat_completion` | OpenRouter LLM provider | `gen_ai.system=openrouter`, `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.request.{max_tokens,temperature,top_p,streaming}`, `gen_ai.response.model`, `gen_ai.usage.{input,output,total}_tokens` |
| `speech:tts` | ElevenLabs provider | `mcp.speech.provider`, `mcp.speech.operation`, `mcp.speech.input_bytes`, `mcp.speech.output_bytes`, `mcp.speech.duration_ms`, `mcp.speech.success` |
| `speech:stt` | Whisper provider | same as `speech:tts` |

A handler that ends its round with `ctx.requestInput(...)` closes its span `OK` with `mcp.*.input_required` set — no recorded exception, no error-counter increment. Multi-round-trip input is protocol control flow, so it never inflates error rates; split on that attribute to tell an incomplete round from a completed call.

### The measured region

A tool or resource call is measured from the start of the handler through the response pipeline that follows it: output-schema validation, `format()`, the enrichment merge, and the trailer render for tools; output-schema validation and `format()` for resources. Telemetry therefore records the outcome the client sees — a failure in any of those is an ERROR span, `success=false` counters, an error-counter increment, and `isSuccess: false` in the completion log, matching the `isError: true` the caller receives. Prompt generation has no post-handler pipeline, so its region is the generate function alone.

Two consequences worth knowing when reading a dashboard:

| Signal | What it covers |
|:-------|:---------------|
| `mcp.tool.duration` / `mcp.resource.duration` | The handler **plus** validation, formatting, and the enrichment merge — time to produce the result, not time spent in handler code. An expensive `format()` shows up here. |
| `mcp.tool.output_bytes` / `mcp.resource.output_bytes` | The handler's returned domain value, not the assembled result. `content[]` re-renders the data the structured payload already carries, so measuring the assembly would double-count it. Nothing is recorded for a call that fails after the handler. |

`mcp.tool.partial_success` and the `mcp.tool.batch.*` counts read the same domain value, so a batch envelope (`{ succeeded, failed }`) is still detected once the result has been assembled around it. For an `output` built with `partialResultSchema()`, the arrays are read under its `failedKey`/`succeededKey`, resolved once per definition from the output schema.

Trace context propagates across boundaries via W3C `traceparent` headers. See `api-utils` → `telemetry/trace` for `withSpan`, `buildTraceparent`, `extractTraceparent`, `createContextWithParentTrace`, `injectCurrentContextInto`, `runInContext` signatures.

## Metrics

All custom metrics are namespaced `mcp.*` (or `process.*` / `http.client.*` where standard semconv applies). Lazy-initialized on first emission; tool, resource, prompt, `http.client.request.duration`, heartbeat, session, auth, rate-limit, and error metrics are eagerly created at startup so series exist from the first export cycle. LLM, speech, graph, and storage instruments are lazy-initialized on first use.

### Tools, resources, prompts

| Metric | Type | Unit | Attributes |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----------|
| `mcp.tool.calls` | counter | `{calls}` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.tool.success`, `mcp.tool.outcome` (`ok`/`error`/`cancelled`) |
| `mcp.tool.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.tool.success` |
| `mcp.tool.errors` | counter | `{errors}` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.tool.error_category` (`upstream`/`server`/`client`) — see [Error category](#error-category) — and `mcp.tool.outcome` (`error`/`cancelled`) |
| `mcp.tool.rejections` | counter | `{calls}` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.tool.error_code`, `mcp.tool.error_category` — once per call rejected before the handler ran |
| `mcp.tool.input_bytes` | histogram | `bytes` | `mcp.tool.name` |
| `mcp.tool.output_bytes` | histogram | `bytes` | `mcp.tool.name` (success only; the handler's returned value) |
| `mcp.tool.param.usage` | counter | `{uses}` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.tool.param` (top-level keys supplied by caller) |
| `mcp.input.ignored_key` | counter | `{keys}` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.input.ignore_rule` (the ignore-list entry that matched, or `underscore_prefix`) |
| `mcp.input.aliased` | counter | `{keys}` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.input.target` (the declared key), `mcp.input.alias_kind` (`declared`/`case_style`) |
| `mcp.input.coerced` | counter | `{calls}` | `mcp.tool.name`, `mcp.input.coercion` (`stringified_array`/`stringified_object`/`integer_as_string`) |
| `mcp.resource.reads` | counter | `{reads}` | `mcp.resource.name`, `mcp.resource.success` |
| `mcp.resource.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.resource.name`, `mcp.resource.success` |
| `mcp.resource.errors` | counter | `{errors}` | `mcp.resource.name` |
| `mcp.resource.output_bytes` | histogram | `bytes` | `mcp.resource.name` (success only; the handler's returned value) |
| `mcp.prompt.generations` | counter | `{generations}` | `mcp.prompt.name`, `mcp.prompt.success` |
| `mcp.prompt.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.prompt.name`, `mcp.prompt.success` |
| `mcp.prompt.errors` | counter | `{errors}` | `mcp.prompt.name`, `mcp.prompt.error_category` |
| `mcp.prompt.input_bytes` | histogram | `bytes` | `mcp.prompt.name` |
| `mcp.prompt.output_bytes` | histogram | `bytes` | `mcp.prompt.name` (success only) |
| `mcp.prompt.message_count` | histogram | `{messages}` | `mcp.prompt.name` |
| `mcp.requests.active` | up/down counter | `{requests}` | — (in-flight handler executions, all three types) |

**Rejections and cancellations.** A call refused before the handler runs — argument validation (`-32602`) or the inline `auth` check (`-32005` missing scope, `-32006` no auth context) — never reaches the measured region, so it is absent from `mcp.tool.calls`, `mcp.tool.duration`, and `mcp.tool.errors` and counts once on `mcp.tool.rejections` instead, labelled with the code and category the caller received. `mcp.tool.outcome` separates a caller hang-up from a failure: `cancelled` for a `RequestCancelled` (`-32011`, always paired with `error_category="client"`), `error` for any other failure, `ok` for a success or an `input_required` round. `mcp.tool.success` and `error_category` keep their meaning, so existing `sum()` queries are unchanged. An error rate that excludes hang-ups filters on `mcp.tool.outcome!="cancelled"`; the failure rate a caller sees is `(errors + rejections) / (calls + rejections)`. Resources and prompts carry neither split.

The three `mcp.input.*` counters are the pre-validation step's metrics. Each marks a call the strict `input` schema would otherwise have rejected: a key rewritten to its canonical spelling, a client-added root key dropped, or a value repaired after the parse failed — a stringified array or object, or an integer sent for a string. `mcp.input.coerced` adds one per repaired call per kind, not per repaired value: a call repairing an array and an object adds one to each `mcp.input.coercion` series, and a call repairing three arrays adds one. A call the step rescues carries nothing about it in its response, so a client artifact spreading across a fleet shows up here first. The counters describe the arguments the handler receives: when a call is retried with the alias stage first (see `add-tool`), the key the retry rewrote counts on `mcp.input.aliased` and never also on `mcp.input.ignored_key`, and a rejected call counts the attempt its rejection reports — the retry's when it ran. The counters are not the only record: every stage writes a debug log naming the key or the repair kinds, the opt-in failure-payload record ([below](#failed-call-payloads)) keeps a failed call's arguments as the caller sent them, and a rejected call reports its rewrites and underscore-rule drops to the caller as `data.input` (see `api-errors`). All three are lazy: a server whose callers never trip a stage emits no series at all.

**Every label is author- or framework-defined — the caller's own key text is never one.** `mcp.input.ignore_rule` is the ignore-list entry that matched or the fixed `underscore_prefix`, bounded by the list's length plus one. `mcp.input.aliased` is labelled by the canonical `mcp.input.target` (a declared property of the tool) and `mcp.input.alias_kind`, not by the alias the caller sent — the case-style half accepts every `-`/`_`/case permutation of a declared key, so labelling the alias would put a caller-controlled set on a permanent series. That is the unbounded-label leak removed from the rate-limiter counter in 0.9.0: a metric attribute set lives until process restart, so anything the caller names belongs on a span or in a log, never on a counter.

**To find the raw key, read the debug log**, which carries `ignoredKey` / `alias` alongside the bounded rule and target — at most its first 1,024 characters, with `ignoredKeyLength` / `aliasLength` holding the uncut length of a longer key. The counter tells you a client artifact exists and how often; the log tells you what it is called, which is what you need before extending `input.ignoreKeys`, declaring an `inputAliases` entry, or renaming a parameter.

### Outbound pacer

`createPacer` (`/utils`) emits four instruments, all lazy — a server that never queues against an upstream emits no series at all.

| Metric | Type | Unit | Attributes |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----------|
| `mcp.pacer.queue_depth` | up/down counter | `{requests}` | `mcp.pacer.name` |
| `mcp.pacer.wait` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.pacer.name` (enqueue → dispatch, not task duration) |
| `mcp.pacer.sheds` | counter | `{requests}` | `mcp.pacer.name` (rejected before dispatch — wait budget or queue depth) |
| `mcp.pacer.cooldowns` | counter | `{cooldowns}` | `mcp.pacer.name` (gate closed by an upstream rate limit) |

`mcp.pacer.name` is the **only** attribute on all four — `createPacer({ name })`, set by the server author and bounded by its own configuration. Nothing a caller supplies reaches these series, for the reason above; which upstream call was shed belongs on a span or in a log.

Read together: `queue_depth` rising while `wait` climbs means the configured rate is below demand; `sheds` rising against a flat `queue_depth` means callers' `maxWaitMs` budgets are tighter than the window; `cooldowns` rising at all means the upstream is answering 429, so the configured `limits` sit above what it actually grants.

### Storage, LLM, speech, graph

| Metric | Type | Unit | Attributes |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----------|
| `mcp.storage.operations` | counter | `{ops}` | `mcp.storage.operation`, `mcp.storage.success` |
| `mcp.storage.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.storage.operation`, `mcp.storage.success` |
| `mcp.storage.errors` | counter | `{errors}` | `mcp.storage.operation` |
| `mcp.llm.requests` | counter | `{requests}` | `gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.request.model` |
| `mcp.llm.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.request.model` |
| `mcp.llm.errors` | counter | `{errors}` | `gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.request.model` |
| `mcp.llm.tokens` | counter | `{tokens}` | `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.token.type` (`input`/`output`) |
| `mcp.speech.operations` | counter | `{ops}` | `mcp.speech.operation` (`tts`/`stt`), `mcp.speech.provider`, `mcp.speech.success` |
| `mcp.speech.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.speech.operation`, `mcp.speech.provider` |
| `mcp.speech.errors` | counter | `{errors}` | `mcp.speech.operation`, `mcp.speech.provider` |
| `mcp.graph.operations` | counter | `{ops}` | `mcp.graph.operation`, `mcp.graph.success` |
| `mcp.graph.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.graph.operation`, `mcp.graph.success` |
| `mcp.graph.errors` | counter | `{errors}` | `mcp.graph.operation` |

### Transport, auth, sessions

| Metric | Type | Unit | Attributes |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----------|
| `mcp.auth.attempts` | counter | `{attempts}` | `mcp.auth.outcome` (`success`/`failure`/`missing`), `mcp.auth.failure_reason` |
| `mcp.auth.duration` | histogram | `ms` | `mcp.auth.outcome`, `mcp.auth.failure_reason` |
| `mcp.sessions.events` | counter | `{events}` | `mcp.session.event` (`created`/`terminated`/`rejected`/`stale_cleanup`) |
| `mcp.session.duration` | histogram | `s` | — |
| `mcp.sessions.active` | observable gauge | `{sessions}` | — |
| `mcp.heartbeat.failures` | counter | `{failures}` | `mcp.connection.transport` (`stdio`/`http`) |

### Error category

`mcp.tool.error_category`, `mcp.prompt.error_category`, and `mcp.error.category` on `mcp.errors.classified` bucket a failure as `upstream` (an external dependency refused or timed out), `server` (a bug or this process's own infrastructure), or `client` (the request itself). The bucket comes from the JSON-RPC code the caller receives — for a thrown value that is not an `McpError`, the code the auto-classifier assigns, so `Error('Request timed out')` is `upstream` and a handler-thrown `ZodError` is `client` on every counter, and all three agree per failure. The span's and completion log's error code for such a value stays `UNHANDLED_ERROR` / `UNKNOWN_ERROR`. The one refinement: `RateLimited` (`-32003`) legitimately carries two sources, so the canvas tenant-cap refusal — which names itself with `data.reason: 'canvas_capacity_exhausted'` — files under `server`, and every other `-32003` stays `upstream`. Retry semantics and the HTTP 429 mapping are the same for both, which is why the code is shared and the stable `reason` discriminator does the separating.

A dashboard reading `error_category` alone therefore no longer needs to special-case one server's capacity limit as an upstream outage, and one grouping `mcp.errors.classified` by origin reads `mcp.error.category` rather than decoding the code with its own copy of the table — the code cannot see `data.reason`. `reason` itself is not on the metric — it is unbounded across a fleet, so it lives on the span and in the log.

### Declared error severity

A definition may put `severity` on an `errors[]` entry — `debug`, `info`, `notice`, or `warning` — for an outcome it models rather than suffers. Two things move, and nothing else:

- The `Error in tool:<name>` log record is emitted at that level instead of `error`, with the same message and structured fields.
- `mcp.errors.classified` gains `mcp.error.severity` on that record. It is set only when a severity resolved below `error`.

The framework's own refusals resolve one without a declaration: an argument rejection (`invalid_arguments`), a `ctx.requestInput` the client connection cannot serve (`client_capability_missing`), and a missing-scope refusal from the inline `auth` check or `checkScopes` log at `notice`, so even a server that declares no severity sees `mcp.error.severity: "notice"` on those `mcp.errors.classified` increments — a bounded split a dashboard can use to separate caller rejections from faults. A missing auth context (`-32006`), a handler's own `forbidden()`, and an upstream 403 stay at `error`. An argument rejection and an inline missing-scope refusal open no execution span and reach no call counter either way; each still counts once on `mcp.tool.rejections`. None of the three refusal records carries a stack, whatever level an `errors[]` entry declares.

The call still failed: the execution span keeps `SpanStatusCode.ERROR` and its recorded exception, `mcp.tool.calls` / `mcp.tool.duration` / `mcp.tool.errors` record the same values, and the completion log still reads `isSuccess: false`. Splitting those series on an authoring decision would redefine what an error rate means. Tools only — resources write no failure record of their own. A cancelled request keeps its own `info`, stack-free path whatever the contract declares. See `api-errors`.

### Errors, rate limits, HTTP client

| Metric | Type | Unit | Attributes |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----------|
| `mcp.errors.classified` | counter | `{errors}` | `mcp.error.classified_code` (JSON-RPC code), `mcp.error.category` (`upstream`/`server`/`client`, as in [Error category](#error-category)), `operation`, and `mcp.error.severity` when a tool failure's level resolved below `error` — a declared severity, or `notice` for an `invalid_arguments` / `client_capability_missing` refusal or a missing-scope refusal |
| `mcp.ratelimit.rejections` | counter | `{rejections}` | — (the rate-limit key is caller-supplied and typically per-client, so it would materialize an unbounded series in the meter; per-key attribution lives on the span instead) |
| `http.client.request.duration` | histogram | `s` | `http.request.method`, `server.address`, `http.response.status_code` (when > 0; absent on network errors before a response is received) |

### Process

Auto-registered when `process.memoryUsage` / `process.uptime` / `perf_hooks` are available (Node/Bun, not Workers). The three memory gauges share a single `process.memoryUsage()` snapshot per collection cycle, refreshed at most every 100 ms.

| Metric | Type | Unit | Notes |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:------|
| `process.memory.rss` | observable gauge | `bytes` | Resident set size |
| `process.memory.heap_used` | observable gauge | `bytes` | V8 heap used |
| `process.memory.heap_total` | observable gauge | `bytes` | V8 total heap |
| `process.uptime` | observable gauge | `s` | Process uptime |
| `process.event_loop.delay` | observable gauge | `ms` | p99 delay (`monitorEventLoopDelay` resolution=20) |
| `process.event_loop.utilization` | observable gauge | `1` | 0 = idle, 1 = saturated |

Every framework log record carries `requestId`, `traceId`, `spanId`, and `tenantId` from the request context, so every log line is searchable by trace. `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pino` does not touch these records: it patches only a `pino` loaded after the SDK starts. To ship the records to the same backend as traces, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` (see Enabling export).

**Errors and nested data.** An `Error` anywhere in a record — under any key, at any depth, and the `err` field an error argument rides in the process log, which leads the record so a line the walk cuts still says what failed — is written as `type` (its `name`), `message`, `stack`, a string `code` (or an `McpError`'s numeric `code` and its `data`), and `cause` and an `AggregateError`'s `errors` in the same shape. A `cause` or member whose stack equals its parent's is written without it, so a rethrown `tryCatch` error and the original on its `cause` carry the throw-site stack once. No other own property is written, so a runtime's request URL (`path`, `input`) or file path (`sourceURL`) stays out of the log; a URL inside an error's own message is written as-is. Objects are kept through 15 levels below the record root, and one 16 levels down is written as `'[MaxDepth]'`. A reference back to an enclosing object is written as `'[Circular]'`. One walk writes at most 16 MiB (16,777,216 characters) of strings, field names, and primitives, repeated or not, each charged about the characters it writes (a string with its quotes, a field name with its quotes, colon, and comma), then writes `'[Truncated]'` — for a field name, `'[Truncated]': '[Truncated]'` — and stops: a 10 MB string is written whole and a 20 MB one is cut, and data a getter builds on every read with 50 fields of a 1,000-character string per object writes 16 MiB, not 284 MB. Repeated content — an object reached again through a shared reference and everything beneath it, or a string or field name of 1,024 characters or more written again — is also charged against 1,000,000 per record and written as `'[Truncated]'` where that runs out. A later repeat that still fits is written, so 20,000 rows sharing one `tags: []` come out whole, while a graph whose 17 objects each refer to the next three times writes 0.4 MB, not 380 MB. One walk also makes at most 400,000 reads — one per object, one per field or array element that is not an object (a redacted field included), ten per object 16 levels down — then writes `'[Truncated]'` and stops, which bounds data a getter, Proxy, or `toJSON()` builds on every read: 0.8 MB in milliseconds, not 308 MB in seconds, and 3.7 MB when each object it builds carries 200 numeric fields. A record of 100,000 distinct one-field objects takes half those reads and is written whole. A value whose read throws — a getter, a Proxy trap, a revoked Proxy — is written as `'[Unreadable]'`, and a class instance (`AbortSignal`, `Map`) is dropped unread. A key is redacted at every depth kept when some run of its adjacent words, joined, equals a sensitive field name, case and separators ignored. Words split at every character other than a letter or digit, at a lowercase letter followed by a capital, at the end of a run of capitals, and around each run of digits: `apiKey`, `API_KEY`, `x-api-key`, `accessToken`, `upstream_private_key`, and `apiKey2` are redacted, `max_tokens`, `MAX_TOKENS`, and `tokenizer` are not. That walk is the only redaction, and `sanitization.setSensitiveFields` extends it. The correlation fields a record's context supplies at its root — `requestId`, `sessionId`, `tenantId`, `traceId`, `spanId`, `timestamp`, `operation` — are never redacted. An added name matching one (`session_id`, `id`) still redacts a caller's own key of that name, and the same key on `interactions.log`, which carries no record context. stderr, the files, and `interactions.log` write the same object. A record key named after a field either pino logger writes on its lines itself — `level`, `time`, `msg`, `env`, `version`, `pid`, and `hostname`, and `err` on a line carrying an error argument — is written as `data_<name>` in the process log and `interactions.log` alike (`data_data_<name>` when that name is taken too), so the line carries one of each, its own: a transport routes it by its own `level` (a caller's `level: 60` on an info record stays out of `error.log`), and a parser reads the server's `version`, not the caller's. The OTLP export writes it too, except the error argument, which goes out as the `exception.*` attributes (type, message, stack), so its `cause`, `code`, and `data` stay in the process log. The `ctx.log` mirror to the client applies the same bounds, markers, and matcher, and writes an `Error` as `{ type, message }` only.

For domain logging inside handlers, use `ctx.log` (`debug`/`info`/`notice`/`warning`/`error`) — auto-includes `requestId`, `traceId`, `tenantId`, `spanId`. The completion log emitted at the end of every handler — at `info`, whatever the outcome — carries a `metrics` payload, with fields tuned to each surface:

| Handler | Log message | `metrics` fields |
|:--------|:------------|:-----------------|
| Tool | `Tool execution finished.` | `durationMs`, `isSuccess`, `errorCode`, `inputBytes`, `outputBytes`, plus `partialSuccess` / `batchSucceeded` / `batchFailed` when the result is a partial-success batch |
| Resource | `Resource read finished.` | `durationMs`, `isSuccess`, `errorCode`, `outputBytes`, `uri` (the same capped URI as `mcp.resource.uri`), `mimeType` |
| Prompt | `Prompt generation finished.` | `durationMs`, `isSuccess`, `errorCode`, `inputBytes` (0 for a prompt declaring no arguments), `outputBytes`, `messageCount` |

Every record of a resource read — scope checks, the handler's `ctx.log` lines, the completion record — carries the read's URI as `resourceUri`, capped like `mcp.resource.uri`, plus `resourceUriLength` when the cap cut it. The handler's `ctx.uri` and the response keep the full URI.

Every record of a tool call, resource read, or `prompts/get` carries the client's JSON-RPC id as `jsonRpcId`, string or number as sent; a string over 1,024 characters keeps at most its first 1,024, plus `jsonRpcIdLength` with the uncut length. `httpErrorHandler`'s records carry the request body's id the same way. It is a log field only — no span or metric attribute carries it — and never the call's `requestId`; the response `id` returns it unchanged. A 2025-era `ctx.requestInput` round trip, which the SDK serves by re-entering the handler, logs each entry under a new `requestId`; the shared `jsonRpcId` ties them together.

A failed tool call or prompt adds exactly one `Error in tool:<name>` / `Error in prompt:<name>` record. Each call — prompts included — logs under its own generated `requestId`, and the client receives that value as `data.requestId` on the call's error envelope, so a reported failure resolves to its records.

An argument rejection's `Error in tool:<name>` record is bounded whatever the caller sends: every string it takes from the rejection — the message (so `msg` and `errorData.originalMessage`), `recovery.hint`, each issue's `message`, each `input` key — keeps at most its first 1,024 characters, and every array its first 10 entries. Each cut records the uncut length or count beside it: `originalMessageLength` for the message, `<field>Length` beside a cut string, `<field>Count` beside a cut array, and `<field>Lengths` — the uncut length of each entry kept — beside an array one of whose entries was cut. A rejection within the caps carries no such field. The `-32602` result the caller receives is built from the uncut rejection.

### Failed-call payloads

Off by default. With `LOG_TOOL_FAILURE_PAYLOADS=true`, a failed tool call writes one more record right after its `Error in tool:<name>` record: message `Tool failure payload: <name>`, the same request context (`requestId`, `traceId`, `spanId`, `toolName`), and the same level, a declared `severity` and the `notice` of a framework refusal included. A payload record below `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` is dropped with its `Error in tool:` record, so at `warning` or above an argument rejection writes neither.

| Field | Content |
|:------|:--------|
| `toolInput` | The arguments as the caller sent them, before pre-validation drops or renames a key |
| `toolResult` | The `CallToolResult` the tool returned. On 2026-07-28 the SDK adds `resultType` and `_meta` serverInfo on the wire after the record is written |
| `toolInputTruncated` / `toolResultTruncated` | Whether that payload was cut at `LOG_TOOL_FAILURE_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` (default `16384`) |

Each payload is redacted with `sanitization.sanitizeForLogging`, serialized, then cut on a UTF-8 character boundary, each on its own. They are strings, not objects, so the byte cap bounds each one and a payload of any depth is written whole up to it — within the 16 MiB of characters one record's walk writes — never cut at the logger's 16-level depth bound. Covered: `auth` refusals, argument rejections (`-32602`), handler throws, and output/enrichment contract failures. Nothing is written for a success, a `RequestCancelled`, or an `input_required` return, nor for resource and prompt failures.

The record goes wherever the error record goes: stderr, `combined.log`, and OTLP when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` is set. On Workers, where no file sink exists, set the flag as a Worker binding. It passes the `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` filter and the rate limit like any record, and its message is constant per tool, so when one tool fails more than `MCP_LOG_RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD` times in a window, only the first payloads are kept. **Redaction matches key names only.** A secret inside a free-form value, such as a token pasted into a `query` or a connection string in an error message, is written as-is. Enable it only where the log store is trusted with caller data.

## Custom instrumentation

Need a span or metric for your own service? Use the helpers from `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/utils` (full signatures in `api-utils` → `Telemetry`):

```ts
import { withSpan, createCounter, createHistogram } from '@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/utils';

const myOps = createCounter('myservice.operations', 'My service ops', '{ops}');
const myDuration = createHistogram('myservice.duration', 'My service duration', 'ms');

export async function doWork() {
  return withSpan('myservice.do_work', async (span) => {
    const t0 = performance.now();
    try {
      const result = await reallyDoWork();
      span.setAttribute('myservice.items', result.length);
      return result;
    } finally {
      myDuration.record(performance.now() - t0);
      myOps.add(1);
    }
  }, { 'myservice.region': 'us-west' });
}
```

Span context propagates automatically — `withSpan` calls inside a `tool_execution:*` span appear as children. `runInContext(ctx, fn)` re-establishes the span `ctx` names as the active one across async boundaries (`setTimeout`, `queueMicrotask`), so spans opened inside `fn` parent to the request's span.

For attribute keys, prefer the `ATTR_*` constants exported from `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/utils` (telemetry/attributes) over hand-typed strings — keeps you in step with framework conventions and avoids typos. Standard OTel semantic conventions (HTTP, cloud, service, network, etc.) are NOT re-exported — import those directly from `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`.

## Visualization

An example Grafana dashboard JSON and vendor-agnostic query recipes (Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb) live at [`docs/telemetry/`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/tree/main/docs/telemetry) in the framework source — not bundled in the npm package, so consult the GitHub repo.

## Cardinality discipline

Series are cheap to emit but expensive to store and query. The framework deliberately keeps high-cardinality identifiers off metric attributes and on spans only. Follow the same rule when adding your own metrics.

| On metrics | On spans / logs only |
|:-----------|:---------------------|
| `mcp.resource.name` (URI template) | `mcp.resource.uri` (URI with IDs, capped at 1,024 characters), `mcp.resource.uri_length` |
| `gen_ai.request.model` (bounded enum) | `mcp.tenant.id`, `mcp.client.id`, `mcp.auth.subject` |
| Bounded enum / template strings | Per-request unique IDs, free-form user input, opaque tokens |

When in doubt: if the attribute can take more than ~100 distinct values across a fleet's runtime, it belongs on the span, not the metric.
