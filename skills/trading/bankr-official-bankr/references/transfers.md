# Transfers Reference

Send tokens to addresses, ENS names or social handles. The agent accepts every recipient format; the CLI and Wallet API take addresses (the CLI also resolves ENS).

## Recipient formats

| Format | Example | Agent | `bankr wallet transfer` | `POST /wallet/transfer` |
|--------|---------|:-----:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| EVM address | `0x1234…abcd` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Solana address | `9xKc…abc` | ✓ | — | — |
| ENS / Basename / cb.id | `vitalik.eth`, `name.base.eth`, `name.cb.id` | ✓ | ✓ (resolved first) | — (resolve first) |
| X / Farcaster / Telegram | `@handle` | ✓ | — | — |

**Social handles** (agent): pass the bare username — no `.eth` suffix, even if the display name has one.

- An **X or Farcaster** username resolves to that account's Bankr wallet. If the account has never used Bankr, a wallet is created for it and its owner claims the funds by signing in with that account.
- A **Telegram** username resolves only if that user already has a Bankr wallet with that username.
- Resolution is per platform: an X handle resolves through the X account, never through a Farcaster link, and vice versa.
- On X, Farcaster or Telegram, a bare `@handle` means a handle on that platform. Name another platform ("@bob on farcaster") to send there.
- ENS doesn't apply to Solana sends; use a Solana address or a handle.

## Agent

```bash
bankr agent prompt "Send 0.5 ETH to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb on base"
bankr agent prompt "Send \$20 of USDC to vitalik.eth"
bankr agent prompt "Send 10% of my BNKR to @friend on Farcaster"
bankr agent prompt "Send 1 SOL to 9xKc...abc"
```

- **Amounts:** exact (`0.1 ETH`), USD (`$50`) or a percentage of the balance (`50%`, "all").
- **Chain:** name it to be sure. Otherwise the agent sends a token from a chain where you hold it (it won't send a ticker you don't hold), and a native token from Base when that wallet has gas there, else from the chain with the largest native balance.
- **Short balance:** when a native token or USD stablecoin send is short on that chain, the agent swaps in the difference from stablecoins or native tokens on the same chain, then sends the named token — only in a Bankr wallet whose gas Bankr is sponsoring. Otherwise, or for other tokens, the insufficient-balance error lists what could be swapped from.
- **Many recipients:** "send 5 USDC each to 0xAAA…, 0xBBB… and @carol" batches same-chain ERC-20 sends into **one atomic transaction** (every leg pays or none does); native sends and other chains go one transaction at a time. Your wallet's spend limits apply to the batch's total USD value.
- **Burns:** "burn 1000 BNKR" sends the tokens to `0x…dead` on EVM chains. The zero address is refused, and burning isn't possible on Arc.
- Bankr Club members can also airdrop a token, from the web terminal, X or Farcaster, to Club members who replied to a post (up to 100, with follower, repost, comment and random-sample filters) or to the top Club members by rank.

## CLI

```bash
bankr wallet transfer --to 0x1234... --token USDC --amount 50
bankr wallet transfer --to vitalik.eth --token USDC --amount 50 --chain base
bankr wallet transfer --to name.base.eth --native --amount 0.01
```

`--to` takes a 0x address or an ENS-style name (`.eth`, `.base.eth`, `.cb.id`), resolved via `/addresses/resolve` before anything is sent — without a chain, so a name's Base record wins even with `--chain polygon`; pass a 0x address when that matters. Handles are rejected; use the agent for those. `--token` takes a symbol or contract address; `--native` sends the chain's gas token. `--chain` defaults to `base` and takes any EVM chain — there is no Solana support.

## Wallet API

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bankr.bot/wallet/transfer" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tokenAddress": "0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913", "recipientAddress": "0x1234...", "amount": "50", "isNativeToken": false, "chain": "base"}'
```

- The body takes a **0x `recipientAddress` and a token contract address** — no ENS names, handles or symbols. For a native send, set `isNativeToken: true` (with the zero address as `tokenAddress`). `chain` defaults to `base`; EVM chains only. Full reference: [transfer docs](https://docs.bankr.bot/wallet-api/transfer).
- Needs a key with Wallet API access that isn't read-only. A key's `allowedRecipients` list and the wallet's own security settings (spend limits, permitted recipients, pause) are enforced: an allowlist or pause rejection is `403`, a spend-limit or permitted-recipient rejection comes back as `400` with the reason.

**Resolving a name yourself** — `GET /addresses/resolve` is public (no API key):

```bash
curl "https://api.bankr.bot/addresses/resolve?value=vitalik.eth&type=ens&chain=polygon"
# → { "resolved": true, "address": "0x...", "displayName": "vitalik.eth" }
```

`type` is `address`, `ens`, `twitter` or `farcaster`. Pass the destination `chain` for ENS — records are chain-aware, and a name's Base record can be a Base-only smart wallet; without it, the Base record wins. X and Farcaster lookups resolve (and create) the account's Bankr wallet, as above. A miss answers `200` with `resolved: false`. `GET /users/search?query=<prefix>` autocompletes Bankr users by X or Farcaster username.
